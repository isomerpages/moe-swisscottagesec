<p>Swiss Cottage celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2013. Fifty years of
establishment is a significant milestone for a school in a young country
like Singapore. Today Swiss Cottage is recognised as one of the most esteemed
government schools in Singapore. It is a school with a rich heritage, well-established
educational practices and multitudes of school, group and individual achievements
including academic, character development and community service awards.
The success of Swiss Cottage is attributed to the past 50 years of school-building
by its school leaders, staff, students and school community in developing
the Swiss Spirit. The school started in 1962 with about 200 pupils, housed
at Raffles Institution at Bras Basah Road. In July 1963, students and staff
moved into a new school premise at Swiss Cottage Estate (along Dunearn
Road), which officially opened in November 1963, with an enrolment of about
870 pupils in two media, namely English and Malay.</p>
<p>The Swiss Spirit was formed since the founding of the school in 1963.
Under the leadership of the first Principal, Mr R.D. Jansen, from 1963
to 1968, the Swiss Spirit originated as the spirit of national integration
through sports. Swiss Cottage was born against the backdrop of the need
for national survival and national integration. The school motto, Scientiae
Patriaeque Gratia, ‘For the Sake of Learning and For the State’, challenges
the students to strive to be educated for the good of the nation and for
mankind. In 1966, the then Minister of Law and National Development, Mr
E.W. Barker, described Swiss Cottage as one of the foremost integrated
schools in Singapore.</p>
<p>It was the second Principal of Swiss, Mr Rudy Mosbergen, who brought Swiss
Cottage to new peaks from 1969 to 1975. A distinguished sportsman himself,
Mr Mosbergen was a strong believer of all-round education. Besides academic
and sports pursuits, Mr Mosbergen mooted the idea of character building.
He introduced the Swiss Code of Conduct and later emphasized on reading
as a means for the inquisition of knowledge for one’s mastery of words
and intellect. For the first time, there was an official articulation of
the Swiss Spirit in 1969 when Mr Morsbergen defined it as a spirit of dedication
and devotion to duty, a spirit of service and sacrifice, and the spirit
of cooperation and pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>The pursuit for excellence continued under the leadership of Mr Chow Kye
Lock who was the principal of the school from 1976 to 1989. The Swiss Student
would not be complete without a passion for the arts. It was Mr Chow Kye
Lock who ignited the love for the arts in a national movement to make Singapore
a gracious society. Under Mr Chow’s leadership, he instituted the Festival
of the Performing Arts, Swiss Drama Nite and The Swiss Arts Centre, which
led the GROW Magazine in 1980 to describe Swiss Cottage as a school ‘leading
in the fields of artistic and cultural pursuits’.</p>
<p>The Swiss Spirit lived on when Mr Dorai Natarajan took over the school
from 1991 to 1997 and the school relocated to its current Bukit Batok campus.
Mr Natarajan further defined the Swiss Spirit as a commitment by both teachers
and students to achieve excellence in both academic and non-academic pursuits,
loyalty to school and nation, and care and concern for the less fortunate
members of society. In preparation for the Swiss Student to live up to
this call, the Pastoral Care and Career Guidance and the Leadership Training
Camp were installed. In fact, the spirit of excellence continued through
Mr Natarajan who believed that excellence in both the academic and non-academic
domains was inter-related. When he retired in 1997, Swiss Cottage was at
greater new heights and was ranked top 19 in Singapore.</p>
<p>Holistic Development was further exemplified when Mr Gan Chee Hau took
over the school in 1997. Mr Gan envisioned the school to be ‘A Vibrant
Learning Community’ where our community involvement programmes flourished
with many collaborative projects. The Swiss Enrichment was conceived and
students had the opportunity to be exposed to different art forms or sports.
We had programmes ranging from Scuba diving to archery, and guitar to language
classes.</p>
<p>Miss Tay Lai Ling brought Swiss Cottage to higher new peaks when she led
the school from 2003 to 2007. Under her leadership, Swiss Cottage achieved
its first Character Development Award and the first Lee Kuan Yew All-Round
Excellence Award. In 2005, we broke the school record and achieved the
best performance by the express stream at the ‘O’ Level. CCA also reached
new heights. Our Science and Technology Club consistently swept away many
prizes at national competitions and subsequently represented Singapore
in robotics competitions in China and Turkey. The school also completed
its PRIME Upgrading at the end of 2005.</p>
<p>The seventh Principal, Mr Liu Earnler led the school in the dream of a
Swiss Student for the new century. Leadership development received a new
boost when he led the whole school in the vision for Swiss Students to
be ‘Thoughtful Leaders’ who think, care and lead with PRIDE. Under Mr Liu’s
leadership, the school received its second Character Development Award
and its second Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence Award. In 2012, the express
stream achieved results equal to that in 2005 and the Sec 5 normal academic
stream achieved the best ‘O’ Level results in Swiss History.</p>
<p>The eighth Principal, Mr Heng Yew Seng brought the school to new peaks
of excellence. He helped establish the school Total Curriculum, which included
the academic curriculum, the school Character and Citizenship Education
curriculum as well as the school’s three distinctive programmes, namely
the Learning for Life Programme on Thoughtful Leadership, the Applied Learning
Programme in Applied Sciences for Sustainable Development as well as the
Enhanced Citizenship Education Programme. The Total Curriculum strengthened
the holistic development of Swiss’ students and prepare them to be well-rounded
individuals. It is therefore not a surprise that under Mr Heng’s leadership,
the school received its third and fourth Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence
Awards.</p>
<p>To take the school to its next lap of greatness, Mr Sherwin Cheng, the
ninth Principal, refreshed the school’s values and further clarified the
school’s vision of Thoughtful Leadership. The twin values of Honour and
Humility were adopted as the pivotal drivers that would bring the desired
balance to the learning, character and leadership dispositions of the Thoughtful
Leader. In turn, these dispositions were infused into all aspects of learning
so that the Total Curriculum would be delivered in an intentional and coherent
way. He also advocated that we extend care, choice and agency in designing
student experiences. He emphasised that the essence of leadership (that
of thoughtfulness) would be better instilled in students when the learning
experiences that we provide model and extend care for our students. He
also strongly believed that student voice and agency must be developed
in an environment where students get opportunities to exercise choice to
truly enjoy personal and collective ownership over decision-making. These
ideals underpin the school’s Total Curriculum framework to make it future-ready.</p>
<p>The school is currently led by its tenth principal, Mdm Mandy Cheng, who
took over the leadership of the school in Dec 2022.</p>
<p>Today Swiss Cottage is on its journey to develop Swiss Students to be
Thoughtful Leaders and the school has the best conditions to do so. Its
academic programmes are at the peak; its CCAs are well established; its
character development programmes are well recognised. In addition, with
its Student Leadership and Values-in-Action programmes well-anchored in
strong school values, the school has what it takes to develop leaders for
the 21st century.</p>
<p>The school has a strong School Advisory Committee, comprising successful
people from different industries to advise the school. The Parents Support
Group and Alumni are also very active and supportive. Above all, Swiss
has one of the most dedicated teaching forces. So far two teachers from
Swiss Cottage had been awarded the Outstanding Youth in Education Award.
Swiss teachers are well-known among parents for being caring and dedicated
and we are one of the most sought-after schools in this part of the country.</p>
<p>Mr Mosbergen said the following in his Annual Speech Day in 1975:
<br>“If the minds of our pupils have been quickened,
<br>If their bodies have been developed,
<br>If their characters have been molded,
<br>If the appreciation for the arts has been enhanced,
<br>If their civic-consciousness and social-mindedness have been heightened,
<br>Then we know that our pupils have received an all-rounded education which
hopefully will fit them for adult life”</p>
<p>Each of the former Swiss principals has played a critical role in driving
the vision of an all-rounded education in Swiss that Mr Mosbergen articulated
in 1975. It is therefore the school’s conviction to build on the past good
work to further enhance the quality of education offered at Swiss Cottage.
It is the school’s commitment that every staff and student will be well
cared for in Swiss Cottage, and its staff will ensure that every lesson
is a good lesson, and every learning activity is purposeful.</p>
<p>Now, the school has a student population of about 1,200 and is one of
the choice schools in the west. May the Swiss Spirit live on in the pursuit
of excellence and for the sake of learning. May Swiss Thoughtful leaders
continue to blaze a path of glory in this vibrant learning community so
that they are fully prepared for the state.</p>
