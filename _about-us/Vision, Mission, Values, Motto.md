| <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>VISION:</b> </span>  |    <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>Thoughtful Leaders</b> </span>                              |
|          | The world today needs Thoughtful Leaders. The future economy and our world points to nurturing individuals who can embrace change and chaos with discretion.  As Thoughtful Leaders, we are grounded in values so that we can weed out distracters and focus on meaningful change. The Thoughtful Leader exerts a positive influence on his surrounding environment – be it the classroom, the CCA, the home or society at large. He is ready and willing to process problems and work towards solutions, primarily by demonstrating care for the human condition as well as by being reflective, critical and inventive.                                                   |
| <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>MISSION: </b> </span>     | <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>We nurture students to be reflective thinkers and caring citizens who lead to serve the nation and the world. </b> </span>                                            |
|          | As reflective thinkers, we learn to consider the bigger picture and understand why we think or decide things in a certain way. When we reflect, we think better before acting/deciding, so that our actions/decisions impact people around us positively. We learn to be reflective, so as to continually learn – to seek, apply and create knowledge – because by developing our intellect to the best of our ability, we can better-contribute to the advancement of our society.<br><br>As caring citizens, we are guided by values and we learn to embrace both our country and the world, so that we develop a sense of universal brotherhood in spite of differences. We learn to communicate better and thrive on win-win solutions. We must learn to respect and celebrate diversity to enjoy harmony and peace – so that we can contribute to build a more equal society – one which is inclusive and progressive.<br>As leaders, we are cognizant of the need to serve. We are purpose-driven and lead to make a difference, not for positional authority. We step forward to lead because we are confident that we can help others, having honed our knowledge and skills in the areas we are leading in. We can work in teams and count on each other – to add value to things around us. |
| <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>VALUES:</b> </span>       | <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>Honour and Humility</b> </span>                      |
|          | A leader with Honour would display a good sense of self–worth, as well as integrity and respect for others. Honour would offer a moral compass that guide and temper choices meant for the greater good.<br><br>A leader with Humility would seek personal growth with a firm belief that one has untapped potential, display self-discipline, appreciate and harness the strengths of a team for shared outcomes, as well as understand the purpose of leadership as service to the community.             |
| <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b> MOTTO: </b> </span>      | <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>Scientiae Patriaeque Gratia<br>(For the sake of learning and for the state)</b> </span>                                             |
|          | Our motto has been with us from the time Swiss Cottage Secondary School was started in 1963. It offers timeless significance; learning is not just for personal achievement but ‘for the state’, and now, we can also say, that it is for the nation and the world.                                                                                             |
| <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>CULTURE:</b> </span>      | <span style = "color: #0eebd8"> <b>Serve with Honour, Lead with Humility     </b> </span>                     |
|          | In Swiss, we believe in teamwork because more heads with a shared vision is better than one. At the core of successful teamwork is an attitude centered on Honour and Humility – in the way we serve and lead others.                       |
