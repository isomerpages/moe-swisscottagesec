“I feel rather surprised because I had achieved a better result for my Chinese than my Combined Humanities. Well, I must say that on the whole, I feel very relieved. I have been working very hard for the last two years,” she reminisced.

The N levels had brought out evidently for all to see, her qualities of organization and determination. As a passionate learner, she never hesitated to clarify her doubts with her teachers. Her reflective and conscientious nature coupled with her drive to do well in everything that she undertakes brought her consistent success. For example, she was awarded the Good Progress Award in 2017 and 2018 as well the Ministry of Education Edusave Scholarship in 2019. In CCA, she was the Discipline and Physical Training Head of Swiss Show Choir, helping to lead Choir to its achievements in the biennial SYF Arts Presentation (Certificate of Distinction in 2017 and Certificate of Accomplishment in 2019 and the Be-Dazzled Show Choir Competition 2017 and 2018 where we achieved Diamond Award for best show choir. Another remarkable trait of Qi En is her strong sense of empathy and willingness to care for others. This caring nature showed up in her interactions with classmates on a daily basis.  She has gone out of her way to coach classmates who needed more help in certain subjects; she has also often being the confidante for students who needed emotional support. Qi En has also the foresight and sense of responsibility to seek the advice of teachers when dealing with some of these problems to ensure that she guides her peers properly. Not surprisingly, in the same vein, she contributed actively as the Chairperson of the D’Hangout crew and also, played a big part in planning and executing the Haunted House during the Swiss Carnival 2019.

When asked how she had time for everything, Qi En said that she loved to organise her time because it in turn made her motivated to do better. “I felt that planning helped me be more ‘relaxed’ because I felt like I had everything under control.” She cited how Mr Goh, who was their Year Master for the last four years, would always reiterate that ‘if they did not wake up and start working, their future may not be as bright as they would like it to be.’

Qi En always a deep need for the approval of her family and this need also paradoxically made her dread failure, a key reason for all her anxieties. Yet she learnt that it was important to also persevere through ups and downs because school life will throw challenges at you.

“Things do not always go the way you hope they do because of your plans. For example, I’ve had my friendship problems. When that happens, I had to deal with the anxieties within myself. I remember how my anxieties got in the way once and I completely flunked my exams.”

It is times like this when teachers matter and how what they say becomes a guiding light. She also appreciates the care and concern of many other encouraging members of the school community, who had stood by her and believed in her.

Now, having achievements in various domains, Qi En has a number of options to consider, such as Pharmaceutical Science, Early Childhood Education and Psychology Studies. Besides the medical field, she has an equally deep interest in understanding the human mind as well as in working with children. All compelling choices but the world is your oyster now.

Like everyone else, Haziq also had to confront the urge to spend his free time surfing the internet, browsing on matters unrelated to schoolwork. However, his sense of awareness helped him prioritise his commitments; he avoided such distractions, especially in the few months leading up to the examinations. This focus remained in spite of a momentary set back during the Preliminary Examinations. He merely passed all his subjects and that would simply not do to secure a place in PFP.<br><br>“I did not give up. Although my borderline results were disheartening, I decided to push myself even further. I put in more work, asked questions and ensured that I cleared my doubts. I even stepped out of my comfort zone and did more than three Practice Papers per subject per week.”<br><br>Clearly, Haziq had a good awareness of his personal strengths and areas for improvement. But what made Haziq so driven? He cited his desire to make his family proud of him and his gratitude for their persistent efforts at raising him through thick and thin. He recalled that his late grandmother always advised him to be courageous when there is a need to step up and perform. One should not be afraid and should not feel down when receiving criticisms or feedback.<br><br>Haziq’s positive disposition and resilience have allowed him to develop his character and make a positive impact on those around him. In the next lap of his journey, Haziq is thinking of pursuing Human Resources and Psychology or perhaps something related to Business.   |
