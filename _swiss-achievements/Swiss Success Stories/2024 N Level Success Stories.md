blood and sweat, we worked hard to plan a parade effectively and efficiently.
That moment strengthened my resolve to lead and influence others.”</p>
<p>Despite his achievements, Zi Rong faced moments of self-doubt along the
way. Reflecting on his past academic results filled him with regret, but
instead of dwelling on negativity, he saw this as a turning point. “That
sense of regret became my weakness, but it also inspired me to make a change
and excel even more in my academics,” he recalled. This mindset shift was
crucial in driving him toward his remarkable accomplishments.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Zi Rong plans to pursue a course in Sports Management.
His passion for sports and fitness, along with his leadership experiences

these interests to build a meaningful career. Zi Rong hopes to continue
growing, inspiring others, and managing responsibilities effectively in
a field that he loves.</p>
<p>Zi Rong’s journey is a powerful reminder that setbacks can be the foundation
for growth, and that teamwork and determination can transform challenges
into success. He also highlights the impact of mentors like Mr. Lau, whose

<p><strong>Overcoming Challenges to Pursue a Dream: Aretha Phoa’s Story</strong>
</p>
<p>Aretha Phoa, a student from 4S5, has achieved a remarkable milestone in
her academic journey. With an EMB3 score of 4, Aretha is elated about her
results. She described feeling “so happy and over the moon” about her performance,
which reflects her resilience and determination.</p>
<p>When asked about the reasons for her success, Aretha shared that the unwavering
support from her teachers and her mother played pivotal roles. “All my
teachers helped me the most in my studies,” she said. Her mother also provided
immense guidance, especially in NFS (Nutrition and Food Science), a subject
that aligns closely with Aretha's passion for baking.</p>
<p>Aretha's motivation to excel stemmed from her deep desire to pursue her
dream course at ITE: Pastry &amp; Baking. This aspiration is rooted in
her love for baking, which she considers her lifelong passion. She explained,
“I have always wanted to study the Pastry &amp; Baking course. Because
of my baking passion, I want to try my best to do well for my results.”
This goal drove her to work tirelessly and focus on her studies throughout
the year.</p>
<p>However, the journey was not without its challenges. Aretha faced a significant
hurdle with the English language due to her dyslexia. She feared that this
might hold her back academically. Determined to overcome this fear, she
adopted creative strategies such as watching English movies, videos, and
documentaries with subtitles. Additionally, Aretha found a unique way to
strengthen her vocabulary by watching a lot of TikTok videos in English.
These efforts not only improved her language skills but also built her
confidence to tackle the subject head-on.</p>
<p>Aretha also expressed deep gratitude to her teacher, Ms. Charlene, for
being a pillar of support throughout her journey. “Ms. Charlene has been
there for me every step of the way, and I cannot thank her enough for all
her guidance,” Aretha said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Aretha dreams of becoming a successful pastry chef in French
restaurants, combining her passion for baking with a pursuit of excellence
in the culinary arts. Her love for baking has been her driving force, and
she is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in her chosen career
path.</p>
<p>Aretha’s journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, the impact
of a supportive environment, and the importance of pursuing one’s passions.
She expressed heartfelt gratitude to all her teachers, saying, “Without
my teachers, I am literally nothing.”</p>
<p>Her story is an inspiration to her peers and a reminder that with determination
and support, challenges can be transformed into stepping stones for success.</p>
<p>Well done, Aretha, on your amazing accomplishment! May your future as
a pastry chef be as sweet and inspiring as your dreams.</p>

<p>Ong Xiang Ting, a remarkable student, has achieved an impressive milestone
in the 2024 GCE N Levels with an EMB2 score and five distinctions. Reflecting
on her results, Xiang Ting expressed both surprise and pride, saying, “I’m
shocked. I didn’t expect to get so many distinctions.” Her achievement
is a testament to her hard work, resilience, and the unyielding support
of those around her.</p>
<p>For Xiang Ting, success didn’t come easily. She attributes her accomplishments
to the steadfast encouragement of her family, friends, and coach, as well
as her mindset of pushing through challenges and never giving up. “Their
support and belief in me kept me going, even when times were tough,” she
shared.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment in Xiang Ting’s journey this year was her experience
as part of her basketball team. “My team and I worked hard, staying back
for extra training and hitting the gym because we really wanted to win
the national championship,” she recounted. It was their final year with
their coach, and they were determined to make it count—for her and for
themselves. Despite facing injuries, Xiang Ting pushed through, refusing
to let her team down. “My team was always there for me when I needed support.
Mr. Alex and my coach were also pillars of strength, offering advice and
pushing me through everything,” she added. This teamwork and determination
not only fueled her passion for basketball but also inspired her to apply
the same discipline and focus to her studies, ultimately excelling in her
prelims and N Levels.</p>
<p>However, the road to success wasn’t without its challenges. Xiang Ting
faced a significant fear of underperforming academically, particularly
in science, Chinese, and CPA. “I was scared I wouldn’t achieve an A for
science during the N Levels, even though I had done so in the prelims,”
she admitted. To overcome her doubts, she diligently worked on past-year
papers, memorized teacher-provided notes, and sought help from her friends
and teachers whenever needed. “I focused more in class, took notes carefully,
and made sure to ask questions when I didn’t understand something,” she
explained. Her determination to do well was driven by a desire to alleviate
her worries and make her parents proud.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Xiang Ting plans to pursue a course in either accounting
or business administration. While she is still exploring her future aspirations,
she recognizes the value of these skills in the workplace. “Most jobs require
these skills, and learning them will help me in my future career,” she
noted. With her strong foundation of perseverance, teamwork, and dedication,
she is poised to tackle whatever path she chooses.</p>
<p>Xiang Ting’s story is a powerful reminder that resilience, teamwork, and
the right mindset can lead to incredible achievements. Her journey will
undoubtedly inspire her peers to strive for their own goals with determination
and a spirit of collaboration.</p>
<p>Xiang Ting, your achievement is inspiring. May your commitment and drive
continue to open doors to success in your future.</p>
