They told me that it is not the end of the world, and that there was still an opportunity to redeem myself. Every time I studied, I thought about my family and their faith in me, and that drove me even harder to do well”. Jared attained an A2 for his Chinese paper in the second sitting.<br><br>Jared was an active member of the school’s Science and Technology Club. He represented Singapore and the school in RoboCup Junior 2015 competition held at Hefei, China in 2015.

He also represented the school in the National Junior Robotics Competition in 2016, in First Lego League in 2015 and 2016. Being the Section Head for Programming, he helped build up the foundation of programming skills for the junior members. His passion for science and technology was evident in his notable participation in the Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) where he achieved the standard of excellence in the SYFC Inter-Schools Aeromodelling Competition. He also excelled in sports, taking part in Triathlons.  He clinched the top position of the ‘B’ Division in the school’s annual Cross Country Meet in 2017.

On top of all these achievements, Jared was also keenly involved in the Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes and events, rallying his peers for community service for sports events.<br><br>How did Jared manage all of this? Jared explained that it was all about having a structured plan to fit in everything – including hobbies. It was the balance that kept the plan going. More importantly, it was important to have the discipline to “stick to it”.<br><br>When asked on the day of results release with seven distinctions in his bag, Jared was spoilt for choice. He could only say that he was open to the many possible paths ahead of him and that regardless of the path he will ultimately take up, an unchanging wish is to continue to be a role model for other aspiring youth.

Initially, I was upset and disheartened, wondering if I could ever pull myself up from the slump I was in. I started to review my past mistakes, and it was through them that I began to learn better and comprehend more, by paying close attention to my weaknesses.

And so, he would advise students to set own personal goals and to dive into the required action in a self-directed way – with self-reliance and initiative. To him, the pursuit of excellence drills down to a simple approach of knowing what one wants followed by a commitment to working hard and a disposition of resilience.<br><br>“In spite of studying hard, I have met with a lot of failures in tests and examinations, especially in the Combined Humanities.

I did not find much passion for learning until after Sec 4N. When I started putting in the effort and learning took place, I started to enjoy the process,” he recalled.<br><br>Zongbin was dedicated to both his academic and CCA commitments. He held the pinnacle rank of Senior Patrol Leader in the Swiss Scouts Falcon Troops. He was a commendable mentor to his juniors and was a pivotal person who contributed significantly to help his CCA achieve its Gold Award.  He was given an opportunity to do the more challenging Combined Science paper at the end of Sec 2 (Normal Academic). He did very well and also achieved the Bronze Award for the Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad.<br><br>There achievements did not come easy. “There were personal challenges that affected my motivation, like finances and parents’ divorce. But I realised that I had to do something about my situation. My mother is very hardworking and she struggles every day. So I felt I had to work hard so one day she can have an easier life.”<br><br>Zongbin took it upon himself to find a job and worked through term time. He contributed his income to support his family and juggled his academic work, CCA and job commitments for the most of his Upper Secondary years. It took a toll on him sometimes and he would look tired. But Zongbin pressed on remarkably, becoming quite a role model for others to look up to.<br><br>“I studied in cafes instead of home because home was distracting. I did many practice papers and had consultations with teachers to clear my doubts. I found ways to overcome my weaknesses, e.g. I watched good videos to improve my English – to pick up suitable vocabulary. I now hope to now start reading more to keep up at my goal to speak and write better. Then there were all my fantastic teachers who encouraged me. I am especially grateful to Mr Sunil, my FT for 5 years, for encouraging me, watching me change and stepping in to help me when I needed it.”<br><br>Zongbin was aiming to apply to the Ngee Ann Polytechnic to pursue biomedical sciences and we are happy to announce that he has been offered a place to pursue his goal.<br>                        |
