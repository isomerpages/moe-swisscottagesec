<p>Naw Blessing’s journey is a remarkable reflection of the power of perseverance,
compassion, and leadership. With a history of meaningful contributions
to her school and peers, Blessing exemplifies all-rounded excellence grounded
in honour and humility. To top it all, her O levels saw an impressive L1R5
of 10 and six distinctions.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her results, Blessing shared, "I am pretty satisfied, but
I’m disappointed with my mathematics score as I expected to get A1 but
got A2."</p>
<p>Blessing’s ability to celebrate success while striving for improvement
reflects her grounded perspective and commitment to growth. Her academic
journey has been marked by her determination to overcome challenges. Despite
failing chemistry during a weighted examination in Secondary 4, she sought
guidance from her teachers and dedicated countless hours to practice.</p>
<p>“I spent many hours completing papers and eventually received a B3 in
my prelims, which encouraged me to keep going,” she said. This persistence
extended to her Mother Tongue studies, where close guidance from her teacher
and focused effort helped her achieve a B3 in Chinese—her best result yet.</p>
<p>In addition to excelling academically, Blessing embraced opportunities
to broaden her horizons and refine her leadership skills. As a participant
in the Student Talent Development Programme in 2023, she explored global
issues, honed her critical thinking, and became a confident communicator
through interdisciplinary competitions, conferences, and workshops. One
notable experience was the Swiss Social Action Forum (SSAF), where she
conducted thorough research and engaged in debates on the future of learning.
For her performance, she was awarded Best Speaker in her class. Blessing’s
passion for literature and communication also came to the forefront during
the National Schools Literature Festival, where she received the Insightful
Analyst Award in 2023. These achievements reflect her ability to think
deeply and articulate her ideas effectively—skills that complement her
analytical and creative strengths.</p>
<p>Blessing also shone in the arts. As Chairperson of the Swiss Show Choir
from 2023 to 2024, she demonstrated exemplary leadership and organisational
skills. Whether preparing for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
(SYF AP)—where the choir achieved the level of Accomplishment—or managing
rehearsals, she balanced firmness and flexibility to ensure success. Her
leadership style exemplified humility, as she worked tirelessly to uplift
her team while adapting to challenges with grace.</p>
<p>Beyond her academic and leadership roles, Blessing has consistently demonstrated
compassion and service. A dependable and empathetic peer, she took the
initiative to assist classmates, managed tasks like attendance-taking,
and served as a constant buddy to a new classmate, ensuring their smooth
integration into the class. For her commitment to helping others, she was
recognised with the 2024 PSG CARE Award, which celebrates students who
embody care, appreciation, respect, and empathy.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Blessing plans to pursue the science stream, focusing
on mathematics, further mathematics, and chemistry, with aspirations of
obtaining a degree in mathematics. “I want to use mathematics to help the
world develop,” she said, underscoring her desire to make meaningful contributions.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her journey, Blessing shared, “I’ve learned to be confident
in my own abilities, and to always stay humble, and to be willing to reach
out and interact with others.”</p>
<p>Blessing’s journey is one of highs and lows, each moment shaping her into
the leader and compassionate individual she is today. Her story is a powerful
reminder that success is not just about personal achievements but also
about honouring one’s responsibilities to the community and lifting others
along the way.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Naw Blessing, on your remarkable achievements and the
exciting road ahead!</p>

<p>Firdaus’s journey is a powerful example of the transformative impact of
resilience, leadership, and hard work. He has proven that success is achieved
through unwavering dedication and determination. Firdaus scored a commendable
L1R5 of 13 with three distinctions, which he is happy with.</p>
<p>“I’m also relieved because I know I worked hard in preparing for my exams,”
Firdaus shared. His achievements reflect his discipline and focus, qualities
that carried him through challenging times, particularly in his academic
pursuits. Despite struggling with Chemistry and Physics in Secondary 3,
Firdaus overcame his fear of failure through perseverance. “My biggest
fear was failing my sciences in O levels because they were my worst subjects,”
he admitted. Determined to improve, he sought guidance from his teachers
and friends, dedicating himself to more effective study methods. His hard
work paid off when he passed both subjects with a B3.</p>
<p>Firdaus’s success extends far beyond academics. As Captain of the Boys’
Basketball team in 2023 and 2024, he led his team to numerous victories,
including a First Place finish in the 2024 National School Games (NSG)
Basketball Championships. “Winning the championship showed me that I could
succeed if I worked hard,” he said. This pivotal achievement not only earned
him the NSG Most Valuable Player Award but also bolstered his confidence
to excel academically.</p>
<p>A natural leader, Firdaus dedicated himself to mentoring younger players
and fostering team cohesion. His commitment to nurturing talent and instilling
discipline among his peers set a high standard for leadership. Reflecting
on his role, he said, “I wanted to help my juniors improve, just like others
helped me.” Through his actions, Firdaus exemplified the school’s values
of honouring self and others by always putting his team’s success and well-being
above his own. His humility in recognizing the contributions of his teachers,
friends, and teammates highlights the strength of his character.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Firdaus is driven by two passions: basketball and the maritime
industry. “I plan to take Maritime Business in university because I’m interested
in the maritime industry. Singapore is a trade hub, and it’s a great opportunity,”
he shared. At the same time, he dreams of playing basketball professionally,
aiming to represent Singapore in the SEA Games and compete at the highest
club level in the nation. “Basketball has been my passion since young,
and I would like to be a professional player too,” he said.</p>
<p>Firdaus’s journey is not just about personal achievement but also about
inspiring others. His discipline, resilience, and dedication have left
a lasting impact on those around him. Congratulations, Firdaus, on an incredible
journey and a bright future ahead!</p>

<p>"I feel a slight twinge of disappointment not achieving the 'perfect'
results I would have hoped for, but I am very proud of what I achieved,"
Daniel reflected.</p>
<p>When Daniel received his O-Level results in 2024, he had much to be proud
of. With nine distinctions and an L1R5 score of 7, Daniel had achieved
academic excellence. Yet, what he can truly celebrate is that his journey
is not solely defined by his grades. His path to success was shaped by
an unwavering belief in balance—dedicating himself to his studies while
still finding time for his passions, like playing the piano.</p>
<p>Daniel’s mindset was rooted in the belief that "academics do not determine
how smart a person is," and this philosophy guided him through his academic
journey. Despite setbacks, he remained focused on what truly mattered:
personal growth and making the most of his opportunities. Daniel's ability
to persevere through challenges became evident after his preliminary exams,
where his results fell below his expectations. A conversation with his
friend, Lim Zhan Le, who told him he was "wasting my potential," sparked
a crucial shift. "I had to cherish the opportunities and talents I was
given," Daniel acknowledged. This moment pushed him to work harder and
achieve better results, showcasing his resilience and commitment to self-improvement.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, Daniel displayed exemplary leadership and character
throughout his time at school. As a Student Councillor and Vice-President
of Operations in the Publications and Media Club, he was a key figure in
encouraging teamwork and collaboration. His leadership style was grounded
in humility, always putting the collective good before personal recognition.
Daniel was known for his approachable and supportive nature, whether in
his roles as a mentor or as someone who shared his knowledge freely. His
humility shone through as he regularly assisted his peers, ensuring they
had the support they needed to succeed.</p>
<p>Daniel's dedication to his community extended beyond school duties. His
positive influence was felt by all who interacted with him, from classmates
to teachers. "The only way for failure to be guaranteed is for you to give
up," Daniel shared, a mantra that motivated both him and those around him
to keep pushing forward, even in the face of challenges. His ability to
turn moments of anxiety into excitement for his exams was a testament to
his mental resilience and growth.</p>
<p>As a recipient of the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2024, Daniel exemplified
the very qualities the award seeks to honour: humility, leadership, and
resilience. Introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2012, the ECHA recognises
students who demonstrate outstanding character through their actions and
behaviour. Daniel’s selflessness, his focus on team success, and his positive
influence on others made him a deserving recipient of the award.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Daniel plans to pursue Junior College with a focus on BCM
(Business, Computing, and Mathematics) and Economics, with the long-term
goal of becoming a neuroscientist. His interest in understanding decision-making
and the science of the mind reflects his desire to use knowledge to improve
human well-being. "I want to understand how our minds work, how we can
train them for more willpower and discipline," he shared.</p>
<p>Daniel’s journey is a powerful reminder that academic success is only
one part of the equation. His story continues to inspire those around him
to push past obstacles and pursue their dreams with passion and dedication.
"Never give up because you can overcome everything."

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Despite initial concerns about maintaining stability across subjects,
Jayandra overcame these challenges through a journey of self-belief, trusting
that his efforts would yield results. As he reflected, “It was a journey
of faith,” overcoming his fears and learning to believe in his potential.</p>
<p>He recalled the anxiety he felt about maintaining balance: “If I did well
in Physics and Chemistry, I wouldn't do that well in Biology.”</p>
<p>Despite challenges with achieving much desired consistency across his
subjects, Jayandra pushed through. Confronting the pressure of O-Levels,
his L1R5 score of 7, with seven distinctions, stands as a testament to
his resilience and hard work.</p>
<p>That was not all. Jayandra’s academic journey and leadership development
reflect his unwavering commitment to personal growth, excellence, and service
to others.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, Jayandra demonstrated significant leadership both in
the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and the Student Council. Rising through
the ranks to become Unit Sergeant Major in 2023, he played a pivotal role
in improving the unit’s performance in drills, physical fitness, and overall
camaraderie. His leadership contributed to the unit earning the Distinction
for Unit Recognition Award in 2023, a clear reflection of his dedication
to raising standards and inspiring his juniors.</p>
<p>As a Student Councillor, his work on the Bonding Committee showed his
commitment to fostering teamwork and unity among his peers. He organised
the Term Three bonding sessions in 2022, planning games that helped Student
Councillors build stronger connections. Additionally, he initiated a thoughtful
celebration of the Councillors’ birthdays, collecting photos and captions
to make each member feel valued. In the Secondary One Orientation in 2023,
Jayandra was an integral part of the operations team, ensuring that new
students had a memorable and smooth transition into school life.</p>
<p>At the core of Jayandra’s success has been the unwavering support of his
parents and teachers. Rather than imposing pressure, they consistently
believed in his potential, encouraging him to persevere despite challenges.
“My parents never pressured me with their expectations,” he reflected,
“They trusted and believed that I had the potential, even when I didn’t
see it in myself.” This belief became a powerful source of motivation,
pushing him to continuously improve. Jayandra also credits his teachers
for their ongoing guidance and support, and especially thanked Mr Christopher
Lim, Mdm Zuli, and Mdm Xu for always being there. “Mr Lim has been with
me since Day 1, and he encouraged me when I shared my aspiration to work
at Boston Dynamics. His advice has been invaluable in both my academic
and leadership growth.”</p>
<p>While his academic and leadership successes are impressive, Jayandra is
also driven by a passion for technology and innovation. “I’m not exactly
clear on which course I want to pursue,” he shared, “but I’m interested
in engineering and computer science.” Inspired by the work of Boston Dynamics
and their development of humanoid robots, Jayandra has long aspired to
contribute to advancements in robotics. His time in NCC (Air) has led him
to reconsider his goals, fueling a newfound desire to serve others through
his work. “I hope to invent something that serves a specific need for humans,”
he said, indicating his ambition to blend technology with a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Exemplified the core values of honour and humility, he consistently sought
feedback from teachers and peers. His humility also shone through in the
way he treated others, always offering guidance and sharing his knowledge
with those around him and reflecting a genuine respect for others and a
commitment to reaching out and raising those in his care.</p>
<p>Jayandra’s story His journey proves that success is measured not only
by grades but also by the positive impact one has on the lives of those
around them.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Wei Qi’s journey is one marked by a deep sense of responsibility, resilience,
and a commitment to serving others, both academically and in her leadership
roles. As the 2024 ECHA Winner and Secretary of the Student Council from
2023-2024, she has played an instrumental role in shaping the school community,
always with a heart full of passion and a mind focused on the greater good.</p>
<p>Despite a busy school life, Wei Qi also worked to do well academically
and went through moments of anxiety like most students. Today, her academic
achievements, including an L1R5 score of 8 with 9 distinctions, reflect
her unwavering dedication to her studies.</p>
<p>“I feel relieved that my efforts have paid off,” Wei Qi shared. “I’m proud
of myself for working hard and pushing on, even when it felt like an endless
cycle of losing and finding myself all over again.”</p>
<p>This resilience was tested when she faced setbacks, particularly during
her English Oral Examination, which led to grave anxiety. But the support
from Mdm June and her friends was a turning point. “They brought me tissues,
consoled me, and gave me the space I needed to release my emotions,” she
recalled. This outpouring of love reminded her that she was not alone,
fueling the motivation to try again.</p>
<p>Wei Qi’s academic success is quite evidently just one facet of her learning
journey in school.</p>
<p>As Secretary of the Student Council, she oversaw the administration of
114 Councillors, meticulously managed meeting minutes, and implemented
systems like the Demerit Point tracking system to foster accountability
and discipline within the council. Her attention to detail and organizational
skills made the task easier for everyone involved, allowing her team to
operate efficiently.</p>
<p>“I wanted to ensure that everything was in place so that everyone could
perform at their best,” Wei Qi explained, noting how she worked closely
with teachers and her fellow Councillors to create a structure that was
both effective and fair.</p>
<p>Leadership, for Wei Qi, is not just about administration; it’s about empowering
others. During the “Diffability” event in 2023, which aimed to raise awareness
of persons with disabilities, Wei Qi showed her emotional intelligence
by addressing the stress her Councillors were feeling and motivating them
to improve the event. “I wanted to make sure everyone felt supported and
understood,” she shared. Whether it was encouraging quieter Councillors
to speak up or supporting Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) to step out
of their comfort zones during Secondary One Orientation in 2024, Wei Qi’s
ability to connect with others and help them grow was evident.</p>
<p>The empathy in Wei Qi’s leadership extended to her role in the Choir,
where she also served as Secretary. By setting up an administrative system
that tracked attendance and meeting minutes, she significantly reduced
the workload of her teachers, ensuring the choir’s smooth operation. During
major events like the Singapore Youth Festival, Voices of Singapore Festival
2022, and the Swiss Arts Expression 2022, her dedication to her craft was
evident. She pushed through difficult dance moves and intense practice
sessions, which culminated in the Certificate of Accomplishment at the
SYF Arts Presentation in 2023. Yet, through all these experiences, Wei
Qi has learned the value of balance—accepting that “good enough” is sometimes
more than enough.</p>
<p>“I used to set unrealistically high expectations for myself,” she admitted.
“But now, I’ve learned to appreciate my worth beyond just my achievements.”
This newfound self-acceptance has allowed her to grow not just as a leader
and performer, but as a person.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Wei Qi is still exploring her future, particularly in the
healthcare field, where she hopes to make a difference. “I want to serve
others in a meaningful way,” she said.</p>
<p>We celebrate Wei Qi’s commitment to her studies, her leadership, and her
service to others exemplify the values of honour and humility.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>When Alby first looked at her results slip, she was “immensely shocked”.
Despite already securing a Direct School Admission (DSA) offer, she never
expected to perform so well. “I didn’t study as feverishly as many of my
peers did because I was focused on pursuing my passion for music,” she
reflected.</p>
<p>With an L1R5 of 6 and 9 distinctions, Alby has not only excelled academically
but has done so while maintaining a rigorous schedule full of extracurricular
commitments that required discipline, focus, and dedication.</p>
<p>But even without the added pressure, Alby remained consistent in her approach
to academics. Her mother, who had always emphasized the importance of consistent
effort, instilled in Alby the value of steady work over cramming at the
last minute.</p>
<p>“I didn’t believe in burning the midnight oil,” Alby explained. Instead,
she preferred to work in small, manageable chunks each day, ensuring that
her studies were always moving forward.</p>
<p>Alongside her academic success, Alby demonstrated a profound commitment
to the Singapore National Cadet Corps (NCC) Command Band, where she served
as Drum Major and Cadet Bandmaster. As a flautist, she put in long hours
of practice to hone her skills, showing “honour” in her role as a representative
of the Command Band. Her leadership and strategic planning helped the band
thrive, and her dedication was not just limited to her personal performance,
but also to fostering national pride through music.</p>
<p>Alby’s ability to lead and collaborate was also evident in her role within
the school’s Performing Arts Council. She played a key part in producing
the finale item for the school’s Diamond Jubilee Concert in 2024, demonstrating
her ability to manage large-scale, complex performances and work effectively
with her peers. She was committed to ensuring the success of this ambitious
project, and the experience showcased her knack for balancing academic
excellence with her leadership in the arts.</p>
<p>Despite her many commitments, Alby never lost sight of her passion for
music.</p>
<p>“I know some people think it’s a ‘waste of my big brain,’ but music is
my true calling,” Alby said, reflecting on her future plans.</p>
<p>Her dream is to become a professional flute performer, whether in an orchestra,
a band, or as a soloist. Alby plans to continue studying music in Junior
College, eventually attending a conservatory to refine her skills and follow
her passion.</p>
<p>Throughout her journey, Alby also participated in a variety of competitions,
pushing herself beyond the confines of traditional academics. From the
Destination Imagination and Global Issues Problem-Solving Competition to
the A*Star Science Award and Text Recital Competition, she excelled in
areas that required creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. These
experiences not only enriched her academic journey but also helped her
develop a well-rounded skill set that will serve her well in the future.</p>
<p>Alby’s journey to success wasn’t without its challenges.</p>
<p>The fear of “failing to meet my own expectations” was a constant presence,
but Alby’s resilience shone through. She was inspired by a quote she found
online, “To look like a master in front of others, you must first be willing
to be stupid in front of others.” She accepted that not everything had
to be perfect and learned to embrace “good enough”, showing the humility
and growth necessary to thrive in her academic and extracurricular pursuits.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Alby’s passion for music and her dedication to personal
growth will undoubtedly propel her forward. “Consistency, resilience, and
passion are the keys to succeeding in whatever you do,” Alby said, offering
valuable wisdom from her own journey. With her sights set on a career in
music and a future filled with opportunities, Alby’s story is one of determination,
balance, and unwavering dedication to her dreams.</p>

<p>While many of her peers focused solely on academics, Sheryl managed to
balance her studies with extensive co-curricular responsibilities and service
to others.</p>
<p>“I never saw it as a matter of balancing schoolwork and leadership roles—it
was about having a purpose and passion in whatever I did,” Sheryl shared,
reflecting on her overall journey.</p>
<p>So, when Sheryl first saw her results, she felt a sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p>With an L1R5 of 6 and 9 distinctions, Sheryl’s academic success is a testament
to her resilience and dedication, not only in the classroom but also in
the many roles she held throughout her school years. Sheryl’s remarkable
journey to her O-Level results is a story of leadership, commitment, and
continuous self-improvement.</p>
<p>Sheryl was a Student Councillor and rose to lead her peers as the President
of the Swiss Cottage Student Council from 2023 to 2024. In her role, she
played a crucial role in amplifying students’ voices. She demonstrated
a high level of people leadership and organisational awareness, spearheading
initiatives that enhanced the sense of community within the school. Under
her leadership, the Student Council organised outreach programmes and welfare
initiatives that had a lasting impact on both the students and staff.</p>
<p>Sheryl’s approach to leadership was always grounded in her core values
of honour and humility. Her interactions with others were characterized
by kindness and approachability, inspiring those around her to follow suit.
“Leadership is not about having a title; it’s about the impact you make
and how you empower others,” she said. She consistently sought ways to
connect with her peers, listen to their concerns, and implement their ideas.
One initiative she was especially proud of was organising the hosting of
kindergarten students during the National Day Parade celebrations, a project
that helped foster a sense of unity within the school community.</p>
<p>In addition to her leadership role in the Student Council, Sheryl was
also the Dance Captain of the Swiss Show Choir, a role that showcased her
passion for dance and her strong sense of responsibility. As Dance Captain,
she choreographed routines, communicated complex moves to the choir members,
and ensured that the group as a whole grew together. In 2024, she received
the Swiss Cottage Secondary School Certificate of Distinction and the Ministry
of Education Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service
(EAGLES). These awards highlighted her resilience, dedication, and consistent
effort to embody the school’s values.</p>
<p>However, Sheryl’s leadership journey was not without its challenges, which
she faced by seeking to constantly learn in every situation.</p>
<p>“I have always sought to improve myself,” she shared, reflecting on her
proactive approach to academics. Whether it was clarifying doubts with
teachers or seeking deeper understanding of complex concepts, Sheryl’s
commitment to learning has been unwavering.</p>
<p>Despite her many achievements, Sheryl remains humble and constantly strives
to be better. She never shied away from seeking feedback, and her eagerness
to grow was one of the key reasons behind her success. “Being humble doesn’t
mean not celebrating success,” Sheryl said. “It means understanding that
there is always room for growth, no matter how far you’ve come.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, Sheryl is excited about the future and the endless possibilities
it holds. While she has already achieved so much, she remains passionate
about continuing her leadership journey and exploring new opportunities
to make a positive impact.</p>
<p>“My dream is to inspire others to believe in themselves and to continue
serving others,” Sheryl said. With her impressive O-Level results and a
future full of promise, Sheryl’s story is one of resilience, growth, and
an unwavering commitment to both her studies and her community.</p>
<p>Also, an ECHA Winner in 2024, Sheryl has proven that resilience and leadership
go hand in hand. Her ability to lead with integrity, serve with humility,
and continuously strive for improvement will undoubtedly guide her toward
even greater accomplishments in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Another pivotal factor in his success was the dedication of Swiss Cottage’s
teachers. During the prelims period, Vinzel took advantage of the school’s
evening study programme, designed to help students prepare for the national
examinations.</p>
<p>"The teachers sacrificed their personal time to stay late and support
us, both academically and emotionally," he recalled. "Knowing they were
so committed to our success motivated me to match their energy and give
my best."</p>
<p>The final months leading up to the O-Levels were particularly tough. "After
prelims, I felt burnt out," Vinzel admitted. Struggling between the desire
to push forward and the need to recharge, he leaned on the support of his
peers and family to regain his focus. "Their advice and encouragement reminded
me of my goals and helped me get back on track," he reflected.</p>
<p>Despite the demands of his studies, Vinzel found time to serve and lead
within the school community. As Head of VIA in the Swiss Publications and
Media Club (PMC), he played a crucial role in coordinating initiatives
that highlighted the school’s achievements and fostered a spirit of service.
His leadership extended to the Organising Committee of the Swiss Social
Action Forum (SSAF), where he worked on projects to promote civic engagement
among students.</p>
<p>One of his most memorable contributions was helping organize a Model United
Nations (MUN) event. "MUN was an eye-opener for me," Vinzel shared. "It
deepened my understanding of global issues and taught me the importance
of collaboration and open dialogue."</p>
<p>Vinzel’s seven distinctions across multiple subjects reflect his consistent
efforts and disciplined approach to learning. He credits his teachers for
sparking his love for subjects like Biology and History, which he plans
to pursue further in Junior College.</p>
<p>"My teachers made every lesson engaging and memorable," he said. "Their
passion for teaching inspired me to push myself and enjoy the learning
process," shared Vinzel, going on to express deep appreciation for the
whole Swiss Cottage community. "To my teachers, thank you for believing
in me and for your constant guidance. To my peers, thank you for your camaraderie
and encouragement. And above all, I thank God for walking with me through
every challenge and triumph."</p>
<p>With his strong academic foundation and a heart for service, Vinzel is
eager to continue growing as a student and leader. He plans to explore
career paths that allow him to combine his academic interests with his
desire to give back to society.</p>
<p>Vinzel’s journey at Swiss Cottage is a shining example of the school’s
values of honour and humility. His ability to overcome challenges, excel
academically, and contribute meaningfully to the school community underscores
the enduring impact of the Swiss spirit. As he embarks on the next phase
of his journey, Vinzel leaves behind a legacy of resilience, gratitude,
and excellence.</p>

<p>Easter consistently demonstrated honour through her actions and principles.
She pursued excellence in her studies with discipline and integrity, taking
ownership of her learning and celebrating small victories even in challenging
times.</p>
<p>Easter’s O-Level results reflect her dedication. With an L1R5 score of
8 and seven distinctions, resilience, and the values she embodied throughout
her time at Swiss Cottage Secondary School.</p>
<p>"I am deeply satisfied with my results and feel incredibly grateful to
everyone who has supported me along the way," Easter shared. She expressed
heartfelt appreciation for the unwavering love of her parents, the steadfast
encouragement of her teachers, and the loyalty of her friends who stood
by her through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Her motivation to improve and persevere was evident in her struggles with
Social Studies, a subject she found particularly challenging.</p>
<p>When her grades dipped during her Secondary 4 prelims, Easter felt overwhelmed.
Yet, with the unwavering support of her teacher, Ms. Lee Si Wei, she persevered.
"Ms. Lee never gave up on me," Easter recalled. "Her faith in me pushed
me to keep trying." Tackling one question at a time, Easter overcame her
fears and achieved the results she had worked so hard for.</p>
<p>For Easter, however, her success extends beyond academics. Her reflections
reveal a profound journey grounded in honour and humility, values central
to her character and achievements. Beyond academics, Easter’s leadership
roles further exemplified her commitment to honour. As a Senior Student
Councillor and Welfare Head, she spearheaded initiatives like Townhall
Conferences, amplifying student voices and fostering a more inclusive school
environment.</p>
<p>Easter’s contributions as a member of the Swiss Basketball Club also reflected
her dedication to excellence. Her mentorship of junior players and her
team’s achievements—such as second place in the National School Games West
Zone Championship in 2024—highlighted her commitment to teamwork and growth.</p>
<p>Easter’s journey also showcased humility, as she approached every challenge
and success with a willingness to learn and improve. She openly acknowledged
her struggles, particularly with Social Studies, and sought help when needed.
This humility allowed her to grow and celebrate her character development
alongside her academic accomplishments.</p>
<p>"The biggest success for me is my personal growth," Easter reflected.
"Swiss Cottage taught me the importance of values and character, which
I believe are even more important than academic achievements."</p>
<p>Her humility extended to her relationships, where she reached out to others
with sincerity and kindness. Whether mentoring junior basketball players,
guiding her peers during mass dance rehearsals for Secondary One Orientation,
or fostering gratitude through the Swiss In-box initiative, Easter’s genuine
nature inspired those around her.</p>
<p>Outside of school, Easter pursued her passion for powerlifting, a sport
that demands patience, dedication, and resilience. Balancing this with
her academic and leadership commitments taught her valuable time management
skills and reinforced her values of persistence and discipline.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Easter plans to attend Junior College and pursue
a career in the healthcare industry. "I have a passion for medicine and
helping those in need," she shared. "There’s no greater joy for me than
being able to support and uplift others."</p>
<p>Easter’s journey through Swiss Cottage Secondary School serves as a shining
example of what it means to live with honour and humility. Her story is
a testament to resilience, gratitude, and the impact of strong values.</p>
<p>"To my parents, teachers, and friends, thank you for walking this journey
with me," Easter said. "Your belief in me gave me the strength to persevere,
and for that, I am forever grateful."</p>
