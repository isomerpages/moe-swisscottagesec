<p>Naw Blessing’s journey is a remarkable reflection of the power of perseverance,
compassion, and leadership. With a history of meaningful contributions
to her school and peers, Blessing exemplifies all-rounded excellence grounded
in honour and humility. To top it all, her O levels saw an impressive L1R5
of 10 and six distinctions.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her results, Blessing shared, "I am pretty satisfied, but
I’m disappointed with my mathematics score as I expected to get A1 but
got A2."</p>
<p>Blessing’s ability to celebrate success while striving for improvement
reflects her grounded perspective and commitment to growth. Her academic
journey has been marked by her determination to overcome challenges. Despite
failing chemistry during a weighted examination in Secondary 4, she sought
guidance from her teachers and dedicated countless hours to practice.</p>
<p>“I spent many hours completing papers and eventually received a B3 in
my prelims, which encouraged me to keep going,” she said. This persistence
extended to her Mother Tongue studies, where close guidance from her teacher
and focused effort helped her achieve a B3 in Chinese—her best result yet.</p>
<p>In addition to excelling academically, Blessing embraced opportunities
to broaden her horizons and refine her leadership skills. As a participant
in the Student Talent Development Programme in 2023, she explored global
issues, honed her critical thinking, and became a confident communicator
through interdisciplinary competitions, conferences, and workshops. One
notable experience was the Swiss Social Action Forum (SSAF), where she
conducted thorough research and engaged in debates on the future of learning.
For her performance, she was awarded Best Speaker in her class. Blessing’s
passion for literature and communication also came to the forefront during
the National Schools Literature Festival, where she received the Insightful
Analyst Award in 2023. These achievements reflect her ability to think
deeply and articulate her ideas effectively—skills that complement her
analytical and creative strengths.</p>
<p>Blessing also shone in the arts. As Chairperson of the Swiss Show Choir
from 2023 to 2024, she demonstrated exemplary leadership and organisational
skills. Whether preparing for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
(SYF AP)—where the choir achieved the level of Accomplishment—or managing
rehearsals, she balanced firmness and flexibility to ensure success. Her
leadership style exemplified humility, as she worked tirelessly to uplift
her team while adapting to challenges with grace.</p>
<p>Beyond her academic and leadership roles, Blessing has consistently demonstrated
compassion and service. A dependable and empathetic peer, she took the
initiative to assist classmates, managed tasks like attendance-taking,
and served as a constant buddy to a new classmate, ensuring their smooth
integration into the class. For her commitment to helping others, she was
recognised with the 2024 PSG CARE Award, which celebrates students who
embody care, appreciation, respect, and empathy.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Blessing plans to pursue the science stream, focusing
on mathematics, further mathematics, and chemistry, with aspirations of
obtaining a degree in mathematics. “I want to use mathematics to help the
world develop,” she said, underscoring her desire to make meaningful contributions.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her journey, Blessing shared, “I’ve learned to be confident
in my own abilities, and to always stay humble, and to be willing to reach
out and interact with others.”</p>
<p>Blessing’s journey is one of highs and lows, each moment shaping her into
the leader and compassionate individual she is today. Her story is a powerful
reminder that success is not just about personal achievements but also
about honouring one’s responsibilities to the community and lifting others
along the way.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Naw Blessing, on your remarkable achievements and the
exciting road ahead!</p>
