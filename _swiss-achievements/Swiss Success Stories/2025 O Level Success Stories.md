<p>When Anand received his O-Level results, he felt a quiet but deep sense
of satisfaction. Achieving an L1R5 of 8, Anand knew he had met the goal
he had set for himself—one that once felt daunting after his prelim examinations.</p>
<p>“I feel satisfied with my results as I achieved the score I had aspired
to,” Anand shared. This was a stark contrast to how he felt when he received
a raw score of 21 for prelims. “I knew I had to improve by at least eight
points,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Anand’s academic journey was marked by persistence rather than ease. Throughout
secondary school, he faced challenges such as slower writing speed, needing
more time to process information, and balancing heavy leadership commitments
alongside academics. Despite multiple setbacks—whether in weighted assessments,
end-of-year exams, or prelims—Anand never gave up on himself. Instead,
he learned to adapt.</p>
<p>One of the biggest turning points came after his prelim results.
<br>“I was really disappointed,” he admitted. “I realised I couldn’t keep
repeating the same mistakes for O-Levels.”</p>
<p>Anand also became more self-aware of his tendency to compare results—not
to compete, but to understand where he stood. This reflection helped him
identify strategies used by peers, many of whom were generous in sharing
their study methods. With guidance from his teachers, especially Mr. Adrian
Koo and Ms. Faith, Anand practised consistently and learned how to manage
his speed through focused practice pieces.</p>
<p>Family support played a crucial role in anchoring Anand through this journey.
<br>“Firstly, my parents kept pushing me and ensuring that I studied. Without
their supervision and guidance, I know I wouldn’t have achieved what I
have,” he reflected. His teachers, too, were instrumental in helping him
grasp concepts deeply and stay on track academically.</p>
<p>However, Anand’s O-Level period coincided with a deeply challenging personal
loss. During the examinations, his grandfather passed away in India, and
his family had to travel overseas for the final rites—leaving Anand to
manage his revision and examinations largely on his own.</p>
<p>“At first, I thought it wouldn’t affect me, but it did,” he shared. “Without
their presence, it was hard to find the energy to study, and I felt like
everything might go to waste.”</p>
<p>What carried him through was the discipline he had built over time, as
well as the support of friends he could rely on. Even in the absence of
his family’s physical presence, Anand leaned on routines, resilience, and
encouragement from his friends who encouraged him—pushing through one of
the most emotionally demanding periods of his school life.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, Anand was heavily involved in student leadership, serving
as President of the Student Council (Sports). Widely regarded as a positive
role model, he was known for being pleasant, responsible, and dependable.
Despite limited time due to leadership commitments, Anand made the difficult
but mature decision to prioritise his studies after standing down from
CCA and Council duties—demonstrating self-discipline and clarity of purpose.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Anand hopes to pursue Biology and Chemistry at higher levels
and aspires to work in the medical industry in the future. He remains deeply
grateful to those who supported him along the way.</p>
<p>“A big heartfelt thank you to all my teachers who’ve supported me through
these years,” he said.</p>
<p>Anand’s journey is one of quiet perseverance, reflective growth, and strength
in adversity. Through academic struggles, leadership responsibilities,
and personal loss, he demonstrated resilience, responsibility, and the
courage to keep moving forward, proving that success is not defined by
speed or ease, but by determination and character.</p>

<p><strong>Muhammad Amjad Amirul bin Mohamed Saai [4S5]</strong>
</p>
</th>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>For Amjad, the O-Level journey was as much about understanding himself
as it was about preparing for examinations. Entering his final year as
the youngest in a close-knit family of five siblings, Amjad carried with
him a strong sense of responsibility, shaped by the care, sacrifices, and
unwavering support of those around him.</p>
<p>Achieving an L1R5 of 8, Amjad received his results with calm acceptance.</p>
<p>“I feel pretty satisfied with my results, and I don’t regret the amount
of hard work I’ve put in,” he shared.</p>
<p>While he acknowledged that he could have started revisions earlier or
managed certain challenges better, Amjad chose to focus on growth rather
than regret. For him, success meant knowing he had given his best under
difficult circumstances—and learning how to do better moving forward.</p>
<p>Family played a central role in sustaining Amjad through what he described
as the toughest year of his secondary school life. During the O-Level period,
he made personal sacrifices, often distancing himself from family time
to stay focused. Yet his family never stopped looking out for him. From
small conversations to constant reminders to rest and eat well, their quiet
care anchored him during moments of pressure and self-doubt. Amjad was
deeply aware of the sacrifices his family made—of time, energy, and finances—and
this awareness became a powerful source of motivation.</p>
<p>“I want to do well so my family knows they can rely on me in the future,”
he reflected.</p>
<p>The academic year was not without setbacks. During the prelim period,
Amjad struggled with time management and mounting stress. In his determination
to improve weaker subjects, he unintentionally neglected his strengths,
sacrificing sleep and meals in the process. Over time, he recognised that
his approach was unsustainable. This realisation marked a turning point.
Amjad rebuilt his study plan, learning to balance effort across subjects,
manage his time more wisely, and prioritise his wellbeing. With adequate
rest and a clearer strategy, his confidence gradually returned.</p>
<p>Throughout this demanding period, Amjad drew strength from the people
around him. Friends organised video-call study sessions, ensuring that
no one was left behind. Teachers checked in on his progress and wellbeing,
offering both academic guidance and reassurance. Amjad also learnt the
importance of acknowledging his own resilience—recognising that perseverance
itself was a form of success.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Amjad hopes to take the junior college route, a path none
of his older siblings had taken. With a strong interest in Biology and
Mathematics, he aspires to pursue Medicine in the future, possibly overseas.
His aspiration stems from a deep respect for the responsibility the profession
carries. To him, medicine is not defined by prestige or financial reward,
but by the opportunity to care for others and save lives.</p>
<p>In reflection, Amjad recognises that balance matters. He believes he could
have spent more time with his peers during his final lap—friends he now
knows he will miss dearly. This reflection shapes the advice he offers
to future students. “One examination will not control your life path,”
he shared. “Setbacks shouldn’t discourage you. There are many ways to reach
your goals; and it’s what you do with your results that truly matters.”</p>
<p>Grounded by family, strengthened by friendships, and guided by a clear
sense of purpose, Amjad has shown that true success lies not only in results,
but in maturity, perspective, and the resolve to keep moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>Ung Helen [4S5]</strong>
</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>Helen had a special approach to the O-Level examinations; they were not
the end of the secondary school phase or about a set of national results
– they were about keeping future possibilities open. With hopes of studying
Physics in junior college and eventually pursuing Biomedical Engineering,
Helen approached her final year determined to do her best, even while navigating
a hectic school life, uncertainty and self-doubt.</p>
<p>When she received her results and saw that she had achieved an L1R5 of
7, Helen was genuinely surprised. “I didn’t expect this outcome,” she shared.
“There were subjects I felt I hadn’t done as well in, so my expectations
were quite low.” The result became a quiet reassurance that effort, even
when imperfect, still matters.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, Helen consistently demonstrated herself to be an all-rounded
student who balanced leadership, service, and learning with thoughtfulness.
She served as a Member of the Publications and Media Club, Vice-President
of the Science Ambassadors, and Class Vice-Chairperson, honouring her commitments
with reliability and integrity. Whether contributing behind the scenes
or stepping up to lead, Helen approached unfamiliar situations with openness,
respect, and a willingness to learn.</p>
<p>A key source of strength throughout Helen’s journey was her support system.
Surrounded by hardworking friends who motivated one another, Helen never
felt alone in her struggles. Studying together, sharing anxieties, and
encouraging one another through moments of exhaustion helped her stay grounded.
Her teachers also played an important role, providing timely feedback and
guidance whenever she needed help to improve.</p>
<p>“I always had someone to turn to,” Helen reflected, “and that made a huge
difference.”</p>
<p>A key source of strength throughout her journey was her support system.

Her teachers also played an important role, providing guidance and constructive
feedback whenever she needed clarity or reassurance. “I always had someone
to turn to,” Helen reflected, “and that made a huge difference.”</p>
<p>The months leading up to the O-Levels were emotionally demanding. Burnout,
anxiety, and the fear of making mistakes lingered even after long hours
of preparation. During one particularly stressful period, a conversation
with a close friend reshaped Helen’s mindset. Her friend shared that no
matter the outcome, she would find comfort in knowing she had given her
all. Though the idea sounded simple, it stayed with Helen. Whenever she
felt like giving up, she reminded herself to keep pushing—knowing that
her future self would regret not trying her best.</p>
<p>One of Helen’s greatest challenges was her fear of failure, especially
under the pressure of meeting scholarship requirements. She was an ASEAN
scholar who had come into the Singapore education system with a set of
hopes and dreams – but who also had high standards to meet up to. At times,
this fear of not making it made studying feel overwhelming, as if her efforts
might be meaningless. However, rather than allowing this fear to paralyse
her, Helen learnt to face it with humility and reflection. Encouraged to
“do it scared,” she continued putting in effort despite uncertainty, accepting
that while the future cannot be fully controlled, one’s response in the
present always can. Through this process, she demonstrated humility—listening
to different perspectives, reflecting on her experiences, and continuously
seeking to improve herself.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Helen plans to pursue the science stream in junior college,
with the goal of entering Biomedical Engineering in the future. Passionate
about technology, she hopes to apply her knowledge in ways that can improve
lives and serve the wider community.</p>
<p>Helen’s journey is one of quiet courage, balanced leadership, and reflective
growth. Through uncertainty and fear, she has shown that honouring one’s
commitments, learning from others, and persevering with humility can open
doors to both personal and academic success.</p>

<p><strong>Andrena Ashley Seah [4S6]</strong>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>When Andrena Ashley Seah first saw her O-Level results slip, she did not
immediately understand what she was looking at. Only after the numbers
were explained to her did the reality sink in. Achieving an L1R4 of 14,
Andrena felt a rush of emotions—relief, disbelief, and joy.</p>
<p>“I felt insanely happy, light, and cheerful,” she shared. “I had feared
for months whether I’d even pass Mathematics and Science. To not only pass,
but to get B grades—something I’d never achieved before—made me realise
that all the effort really did pay off.”</p>
<p>For Andrena, this achievement marked far more than academic success. It
represented a profound personal transformation that unfolded over time—one
rooted in mindset change, self-acceptance, and courage. For much of her
secondary school life, Andrena avoided situations that did not offer immediate
comfort or enjoyment. Studying felt draining and unrewarding, and she struggled
to motivate herself. That began to change towards the end of 2024, when
she unexpectedly found discipline through an unlikely avenue—the gym. Having
never enjoyed exercise before, Andrena discovered that choosing discomfort
for growth reshaped how she viewed effort itself.</p>
<p>“Rather be uncomfortable for a few hours a day than uncomfortable for
life,” became a quote she lived by. The perseverance she built physically
slowly carried over into her academic habits. Even on days she felt tired
or unwell, she showed up—both for training and for studying—embracing the
belief that “whatever happens, happens.” This shift in mindset coincided
with a deeper internal turning point. Andrena began to realise that she
had the ability to change her own life. For years, she had struggled with
intense self-image insecurities, choosing to wear a mask in school long
after restrictions were lifted. What began as a small habit gradually consumed
her daily existence—affecting her attendance, social life, and confidence.
She avoided eating or drinking in school, skipped events, and withdrew
from peers, feeling trapped both emotionally and physically.</p>
<p>The passing of her father in early 2024 compounded this struggle. Grief,
isolation, and insecurity led Andrena to disengage from school almost entirely,
resulting in academic failure and the risk of retention. Yet, even during
this darkest period, she was not alone. Through counselling support in
school, Andrena found a safe space to process her emotions and cope with
daily school life. More importantly, she encountered teachers who believed
in her beyond grades. Her form teachers in Secondary 3 and 4 extended patience,
advocacy, and kindness—standing up for her when she struggled to speak
for herself and gently encouraging her growth. Their consistent support
helped her rebuild trust in herself.</p>
<p>Gradually, Andrena began taking small but courageous steps forward. Participation
in school activities required her to appear without a mask—and each time,
she realised that nothing “bad” happened. In September 2024, she made the
decision to remove her mask fully. What followed was acceptance, reassurance,
and a renewed sense of freedom. This moment became symbolic of her wider
journey—choosing growth over fear, and self-belief over self-doubt.</p>
<p>With renewed confidence, Andrena redirected her energy into her studies.
While fear of failure was present, she was driven more strongly by a desire
to prove to herself what she was capable of if she truly tried. That effort
culminated in her O-Level results—a tangible affirmation of her resilience.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Andrena has been accepted into Nursing at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
While she acknowledges that she is still exploring her passions, she is
comfortable with uncertainty and open to growth. “I don’t want to rush
into something I’m not certain about,” she shared. “And I’m happy with
where I am right now.”</p>
<p>Andrena’s story is one of quiet bravery, inner resilience, and self-reclamation.
Through loss, insecurity, and fear, she found the strength to choose herself—and
in doing so, transformed not only her results, but her sense of possibility
for the future.</p>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>For Gao Yuanji, receiving his O-Level results was accompanied by a quiet
sense of jubilation—one that was quickly tempered by humility. Achieving
an L1R5 of 8, Yuanji was keenly aware that such an outcome had once felt
improbable, even unrealistic, for much of his schooling journey.</p>
<p>“As would be typical, I feel a sense of joy at my results, as they far
exceeded my expectations,” he reflected. “Yet more than that, I feel humility.
I was never a particularly hardworking student for most of my life, and
to have achieved this reminds me of what is possible when effort is finally
applied.”</p>
<p>Academic excellence was not always central to Yuanji’s priorities. In
his earlier years of education, he relied heavily on what he described
as “natural intelligence” to stay afloat. This approach faltered in upper
secondary, where conceptual depth and sustained effort became essential.
A defining moment came in Secondary 3, when he failed his Chemistry mid-year
examination. While initially disheartened, Yuanji chose to channel that
disappointment into determination. What began as recovery soon transformed
into genuine intellectual engagement.</p>
<p>“I developed a true interest in the sciences—especially Chemistry and
Mathematics,” he shared. “Interest became my fuel. Once I found myself
intrigued, studying was no longer a chore, but something fulfilling.” This
shift marked a turning point, as curiosity replaced obligation and consistency
followed naturally.</p>
<p>Yuanji believes that excellence begins with interest. To him, sustained
effort is only possible when one first learns to value the subject itself.
This philosophy guided his preparation for the O-Levels and reshaped his
relationship with learning more broadly.</p>
<p>Yet not all subjects came easily. Yuanji openly acknowledged that Chinese
had long been his Achilles’ heel. As a second-generation immigrant, he
was acutely aware of his cultural differences when he first entered primary
school, often comparing himself to peers whose families had long been rooted
in Singapore. This early self-consciousness led him to distance himself
from the Chinese language, resulting in a cycle of disengagement and difficulty—particularly
in Higher Chinese, where cultural nuance played a significant role.</p>
<p>It was only later, in the more diverse environment of secondary school,
that Yuanji grew more comfortable with his identity. With greater self-acceptance
came renewed effort. While Chinese never became a subject he loved in the
same way as the sciences, persistence prevailed. Through steady practice
and resolve, Yuanji achieved a B3 for Chinese, a result he regards as a
personal triumph of endurance rather than affinity.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Yuanji remains open about the uncertainty of his future
path. While he possesses a strong passion for STEM, he is equally drawn
to the humanities, appreciating both analytical rigour and reflective thought.
Rather than rushing to define his destination, he is content to let his
journey unfold in time.</p>
<p>He leaves others with a phrase drawn from antiquity: “Fluctuat nec mergitur”—tossed
by the waves yet never sinking. “In any pursuit,” Yuanji reflected, “it
is easy to dream of success, but far harder to persist when challenges
arise. What distinguishes those who succeed from those who do not is indefatigability—the
perseverance to continue despite uncertainty.”</p>
<p>Yuanji’s journey is one of intellectual awakening, cultural self-acceptance,
and disciplined perseverance. Through curiosity, reflection, and resilience,
he has demonstrated that excellence is not reserved for the naturally gifted
but earned by those who learn to persist—and to believe in the possibilities
effort can unlock.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>For Aldrich, O-Level results were never the destination—they were simply
a doorway. Achieving an L1R5 of 9, Aldrich felt satisfied not because of
the number itself, but because it allowed him to pursue the academic path
he hoped for. More importantly, it affirmed something far deeper: the personal
transformation he experienced over two years of intentional learning.</p>
<p>“The results were never really the main point,” Aldrich reflected. “What
mattered more was that I improved myself—learning to think critically,
developing compassion, and gaining new experiences.”</p>
<p>This philosophy shaped the way Aldrich approached his studies. Rather
than chasing results, he focused on cultivating genuine interest in his
subjects. Curiosity became his compass. Whether it was reading beyond the
syllabus, exploring JC-level mathematics concepts out of interest, watching
university-level explanations of physics applications, or asking simple
but probing questions such as “Why does O-Level Chemistry teach this?”,
Aldrich constantly sought to understand more deeply.</p>
<p>These spontaneous explorations helped him form a positive and personal
relationship with learning. Studying became enjoyable, meaningful, and
intrinsically motivating. “I wasn’t in school just to pass tests,” he shared.
“I was there to learn about the world, to train my thinking, and to experience
the beauty of different disciplines.” In this way, results followed naturally—almost
as a by-product of engagement.</p>
<p>A turning point came midway through Secondary 3, when Aldrich heard about
a senior who was unable to pursue a course he was passionate about due
to insufficient O-Level results. The story struck a chord. The idea of
being barred from one’s interests because of grades was unsettling—and
it sharpened Aldrich’s resolve. From then on, while grades remained secondary,
he understood the importance of consistency and discipline in keeping future
doors open.</p>
<p>The most challenging period arrived just weeks before the O-Levels, after
prelims had ended. Burnt out and exhausted, Aldrich found himself questioning
whether he could endure another round of intense preparation. “It felt
choking,” he admitted. What helped him regain balance was returning to
the things and people he loved—long walks outdoors, meaningful conversations
with friends, and quiet self-reflection. These moments reminded him that
he had already laid a strong foundation and simply needed to trust the
process he had committed to.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom and CCA, Aldrich was a fine school debater, representing
the school at national competitions and earning recognition for his persuasive
rhetoric and clarity of thought. A strong writer with an independent mind,
he demonstrated an ability to navigate multiple perspectives, embrace ambiguity,
and connect ideas with precision. Despite an active social life and multiple
commitments, Aldrich was consistently punctual in submitting high-quality
work—an indication of quiet discipline beneath his relaxed exterior.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Aldrich plans to pursue the science stream, with particular
interest in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Economics. His aspirations
are grounded not in titles or prestige, but in a desire to understand the
universe more deeply and to continue reinventing himself through lifelong
learning.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his journey, Aldrich offers a thoughtful reminder to others:
“School is hard. Studying is hard. The pressure to perform can be suffocating.
But we must remember the true purpose of education; it is self-improvement,
curiosity, critical thinking, and growth. Grades are just the means. Learning
is the end.”</p>
<p>Aldrich’s story is one of intellectual independence, curiosity-driven
excellence, and reflective resilience. Through questioning, exploration,
and quiet discipline, he has shown that meaningful education is not about
chasing numbers but about cultivating a mind eager to learn—and the courage
to keep asking why.</p>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>When Rithwik first received his O-Level results, he felt a deep sense
of joy—particularly for his languages and humanities, subjects he had found
the most challenging throughout his secondary school journey. Achieving
an L1R5 of 4, Rithwik’s results were a reflection not only of academic
ability, but of perseverance, support, and steady personal growth.</p>
<p>“I feel extremely happy about my results, especially my languages and
humanities,” Rithwik shared. “Although I was hoping my Science and E-Math
would be slightly better, I’m grateful for how things turned out.”</p>
<p>One of the key factors behind Rithwik’s success, he believes, was the
unwavering support of his teachers.</p>
<p>“I think one of the main reasons for my success was my teachers. They
made every subject engaging and were always willing to clear up my doubts.
Especially Mr Kat, who constantly reassured us whenever we were stressed,”
he reflected. This strong teacher–student relationship gave Rithwik confidence
during moments of self-doubt and academic pressure.</p>
<p>Rithwik’s journey, however, was not without setbacks. After receiving
his prelim results, he realised that his earlier approach to studying was
insufficient. “When I got my prelim results, I was very disappointed. I
thought I could do well with minimal studying and didn’t take exams seriously
enough. That was when I knew I had to change,” he said. From that point
on, Rithwik demonstrated resilience and discipline, pushing through moments
when giving up felt easier. His renewed work ethic paid off, allowing him
to exceed his own expectations.</p>
<p>One of Rithwik’s greatest academic challenges was Higher Tamil. Since
Secondary 1, the subject has been a constant struggle, with results hovering
around borderline passes or failures. “I even started to dislike the subject,”
he admitted. Yet in Secondary 4, understanding the importance of the bonus
points, Rithwik made a conscious decision to persevere. He invested significantly
more effort, consulted his teacher, Mdm Vijaya, regularly, and remained
committed despite earlier discouragement. His breakthrough came at the
prelims, when he achieved a B for the first time—eventually passing Higher
Tamil at the O-Levels. This milestone marked a personal victory built on
determination and humility.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, Rithwik consistently demonstrated leadership anchored
in service. As Class Chairperson and Assistant Platoon Sergeant (Sec 2)
in NCC (Air), he modelled principled leadership by encouraging peers to
do the right thing, listening respectfully to differing perspectives, and
fulfilling his responsibilities with diligence and integrity. His peers
and teachers recognised him as someone who led quietly but effectively.</p>
<p>Rithwik also exemplified humility through his thoughtful contributions
to VIA projects and school activities. He consistently helped others without
seeking recognition, driven by a sincere desire to make a meaningful impact
within the school community.</p>
<p>As he looks ahead, Rithwik is considering both junior college and polytechnic
pathways. While he has always aspired to attend junior college, his interest
in cybersecurity has also drawn him to explore polytechnic education.</p>
<p>“I’m conflicted between the two options, but I’m excited about what lies
ahead,” he shared.</p>
<p>Rithwik expressed deep gratitude to those who supported him throughout
his journey.</p>
<p>“A huge thank you to my friends as well—for motivating me and making these
four years the best,” he said.</p>
<p>Rithwik’s story is one of steady growth, perseverance, and quiet leadership.
Through challenges and successes alike, he has embodied the values of Honour
and Humility, demonstrating that true achievement is shaped not only by
results, but by character, resilience, and the willingness to learn.</p>
