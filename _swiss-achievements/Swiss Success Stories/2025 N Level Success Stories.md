<p>“I feel very proud of myself,” Neil shared reflectively. “I spent a lot
of time and effort studying, sometimes sacrificing sleep, and I had to
distance myself from people who were affecting my mental state to focus
on my academics. I got the score I wanted, and I’m grateful for the people
who helped me along the way.”</p>
<p>Achieving an EMB3 of 8 points with 5 distinctions, Neil recognised that
his results perseverance through significant personal challenges. For Neil,
a key factor in his success was the support of his friends. Amid family
stress, which included serious financial difficulties that put his household
on the verge of homelessness, Neil often felt alone. Yet, two close friends
provided constant encouragement. Together, they would meet on a rooftop
with a view to venting and validating each other’s feelings, offering mutual
support despite their own challenges. He also found guidance in an unexpected
mentor — a librarian near his home. Noticing his dedication, she checked
in on him, shared her notes, and even provided small breaks and moments
of companionship during long study sessions. “It’s because people were
there for me that I was able to succeed, even while dealing with family
stress and difficult personal decisions,” he reflected.</p>
<p>Neil’s mother also played a pivotal role in shaping his mindset. Despite
the family’s financial struggles, she encouraged him to focus on his studies
and not worry about her hardships. “I kne</p>
<p>w that if I did badly, it would only make things harder for her,” Neil
explained. “I wanted to make her proud and not burden her with my academic
performance.” This responsibility became a powerful motivation, driving
him to give his best in every study session.</p>
<p>A persistent personal challenge Neil faced was the fear of not being enough.
This feeling had haunted him for years, creating doubt in his ability to
succeed. Determined to overcome it, he committed to a structured daily
routine — attending school, staying back to revise, taking short breaks,
and exercising to refresh his mind. Over time, his disciplined approach
gradually replaced his self-doubt with confidence. “Every day I proved
to myself that I am enough,” he said.</p>
<p>Neil also pursued his passions alongside academics. Encouraged by his
mother’s words, “Live life with no inhibitions,” he began sharing guitar
and singing covers online, prioritizing his own aspirations while balancing
his responsibilities. This self-directed exploration allowed him to reconnect
with himself and brought him joy, reinforcing the importance of living
authentically.</p>
<p>Beyond academic and personal growth, Neil distinguished himself through
leadership and service. As a Principal Player in the Singapore National
Cadet Corps Command Band, he demonstrated clarity, patience, and calmness,
even in high-pressure situations. Teachers noted that he consistently exemplified
Honour, preparing thoroughly for rehearsals and performances and taking
pride in representing the school. At the same time, Neil led with Humility,
guiding his peers thoughtfully and collaboratively rather than through
authority. His presence inspired confidence, and his grounded approach
earned him the respect of both teammates and teachers.</p>
<p>Academically, Neil’s strengths lie in Mathematics and Accountancy, subjects
that align closely with his interests and abilities. Looking ahead, he
plans to pursue the Common Business Programme at Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
a pathway that allows him to explore various areas of business while keeping
his long-term goal of being a globally acclaimed musician alive. He envisions
building a secure future while continuing to nurture his passion for music.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his journey, Neil shared, “It was because of self-discipline
and the love and guidance of my family that I was able to overcome both
personal and academic challenges. I’ve also learned to believe in myself
and live life on my own terms.”</p>
<p>Neil’s story is a powerful testament to resilience, gratitude, and growth.</p>

<p><strong>SUMI CYRUS [4S1]</strong>
</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Sumi captures her journey with a quote she holds close: “Be the lotus
flower that blooms beautifully, even in muddy waters.” Like the lotus that
rises unstained from murky depths, Sumi’s growth was shaped by difficult
circumstances rather than diminished by them. The “muddy waters” represent
the personal challenges, setbacks, and moments of isolation she faced;
the bloom reflects the resilience, discipline, and quiet strength she developed
along the way.</p>
<p>Sumi had faced significant personal challenges. Living with her grandparents,
she grew up under circumstances different from many of her peers. Initially,
she found it difficult to relate to others or find common ground in conversations,
often choosing to stay strong and silent. Over time, she learned that strength
could also mean reaching out. With patience and courage, Sumi began confiding
in trusted adults and school friends, gradually building meaningful relationships
that gave her a more supportive and wholesome school experience.</p>
<p>Today, she stands having achieved a EMB3 of 5 points (excluding English)
— a score she maintained even after the conversion of her O-Level Chinese
results. Her joyful outcome reflects steady effort sustained and shaped
not by ease, but by discipline, resilience, and quiet perseverance.</p>
<p>“I don’t study using motivation,” Sumi shared. “I study using discipline,
because consistency is key to maintaining my results.”</p>
<p>This belief anchored her throughout her school years, helping her remain
focused even when personal and academic pressures weighed heavily on her.
For example, one of Sumi’s key academic challenges was sustaining her strong
performance. She addressed this through consistent habits — paying close
attention during tuition and school lessons, asking questions to clarify
misunderstandings, and practising independently at home. These strategies
allowed her to address gaps in understanding promptly and maintain her
results.</p>
<p>A representative of the school’s basketball team, teachers describe how
Sumi is a student who exemplifies the school values of Honour and Humility
in both academics and sports by giving her best effort and contributing
consistently. With a strong growth mindset, she embraced challenges as
opportunities to improve and develop further. For example, during the year,
she suffered a torn Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) — a key ligament in
the knee that stabilises the joint and is essential for running, jumping,
and sudden movements. This injury prevented her from competing in the B
Division and required significant recovery time. Rather than letting this
setback discourage her, Sumi reframed it as an opportunity to focus on
her studies. She remained disciplined, redirected her energy into learning,
and used the time to strengthen her academic foundations, demonstrating
remarkable resilience and determination.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Sumi aspires to pursue Hospitality and Tourism Management
at the Polytechnic. Drawn by opportunities such as internships with Singapore
Airlines, she hopes to become a flight attendant in the future. With limited
opportunities to travel at present, she sees this pathway as a meaningful
way to explore the world while building a fulfilling career.</p>
<p>As she prepares for the next chapter of her educational journey, Sumi’s
story stands as a powerful reminder that with perseverance and self-belief,
even the most challenging environments can nurture growth and success.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Aqil felt a deep sense of pride and relief. Having achieved an EMB3 of
8 points with 4 distinctions, Aqil recognised that it represented something
significant — the result of sustained effort, resilience, and personal
growth. “Even though I didn’t meet my target, I am actually quite happy
about my results,” Aqil shared. “I’m glad that I put in the effort throughout
the year and didn’t give up.”</p>
<p>A defining turning point came when Aqil reflected on his earlier academic
performance. Having obtained a raw aggregate of 21 previously, he realised
just how unprepared he had been for the demands of the N Levels. Determined
to change, Aqil returned to school in January with a renewed mindset. He
focused more consistently in class, completed his homework diligently,
and committed to regular self-revision. This shift in attitude and work
ethic proved transformative, enabling him to reduce his aggregate from
21 to 8 — a remarkable testament to his determination and discipline.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, Aqil faced challenges in maintaining motivation,
particularly with distractions from mobile phones and social media. Rather
than allowing these obstacles to derail his progress, he sought practical
solutions. Studying with friends helped him stay focused and motivated,
while also giving him opportunities to clarify doubts and strengthen his
understanding of key concepts. Hence, for Aqil, success was never a solitary
journey. He attributed his perseverance largely to the encouragement he
received from the people around him.</p>
<p>“My family and friends kept my drive going. They reminded me that it would
be a waste not to try because I had so much more potential.”</p>
<p>Beyond academics, Aqil made significant contributions to school life through
his leadership in the Command Band. Serving as the Sergeant Major and Ceremonial
Drum Major, he led with discipline, empathy, and precision. His leadership
was most notably showcased when he commanded the 2024 National Day Parade,
where he demonstrated exceptional confidence and skill under pressure.
Teachers describe Aqil as a student who exemplifies the school values of
Honour and Humility. He consistently upheld integrity and responsibility
in all his duties, placing the Band’s needs before his own and carrying
out every task with sincerity and commitment. As a leader, Aqil listened
attentively to others’ perspectives and supported his peers quietly, earning
their respect through actions rather than recognition.</p>
<p>Academically, Aqil’s strengths are reflected in his achievement of Grade
1 in both Mathematics and Science, subjects that align closely with his
interests and abilities. Looking ahead, he aspires to pursue Biomedical
Engineering at the Polytechnic, motivated by a desire to contribute meaningfully
to the community and nation through technology. This aspiration also holds
personal significance, as it fulfils a long-standing hope of his father
— a source of motivation that continues to drive him forward.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his journey, Aqil shared a powerful lesson he hopes others
will take to heart: “The man I am today could have prevented my past mistakes,
but if I had prevented them, I wouldn’t be the man I am today. Don’t let
hardships ruin your progress — let them improve it.”</p>
<p>As Aqil stands ready to embark on the next chapter of his educational
journey, he remains deeply grateful to his friends, family, and teachers
who supported him throughout these four years. His story is one of resilience,
growth, and leadership — a reminder that with determination, support, and
self-belief, challenges can be transformed into stepping stones for success.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Putri’s four-year school journey has been one of growth, resilience, and
purposeful leadership. Achieving an EMB3 of 13 points with 2 distinctions,
she felt a mix of pride and disappointment. While she had worked hard,
she did not qualify for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) — a
moment that could have been discouraging. Yet, Putri reminded herself to
focus on the bigger picture. She recognised that there are multiple pathways
to achieving her goals, whether through the Direct Polytechnic Programme
(DPP) to pursue nursing or returning to complete the O Levels via the 5N
course.</p>
<p>She reflected, “I was fortunate to have helpful seniors around me and
strong support from my friends.” Her seniors guided her through secondary
school, offering advice, sharing experiences, and encouraging her whenever
she felt unsure. Her friends provided emotional reassurance, reminding
her to take breaks and care for herself, which helped her stay motivated
even during demanding periods.</p>
<p>Putri’s commitment to her studies was deeply personal. She felt a strong
sense of responsibility toward her mother’s support and encouragement.
“I realised that if I did not improve my grades, I would be disappointing
my mother, who has always believed in me,” she reflected. This awareness
prompted her to take ownership of her learning. She revised consistently,
sought help when needed, and structured her time effectively. Over time,
these disciplined efforts led to improved grades and reinforced her confidence
and determination.</p>
<p>Balancing academics with leadership and co-curricular commitments was
another challenge. As Warrant Officer and Head of Training in her CCA,
Putri led the Precision Drill Challenge team, mentored juniors, and managed
training programs that contributed to the corps’ Distinction Awards from
2022 to 2024. The workload was demanding, and at times, she felt stressed
by high expectations and the responsibility of guiding others. She overcame
this by managing her time, breaking tasks into achievable goals, and drawing
strength from the support of friends and mentors.</p>
<p>Teachers described Putri as a student who exemplifies Honour and Humility.
She led with integrity, upheld high standards, and consistently prioritised
the welfare and development of her cadets and peers. Her leadership has
been characterised by empathy and service; she focused on the growth and
success of those around her without seeking recognition, earning the respect
and admiration of both students and staff.</p>
<p>Her experiences in CCA also helped shape her career aspirations. Through
hands-on training, she gained basic nursing knowledge, practical first
aid skills, and experience in caring for others. These experiences inspired
her to pursue a career in nursing, motivated by a desire to support people
through difficult situations and make a meaningful impact on their lives.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her journey, Putri advised her juniors as such: “Don’t procrastinate,
focus on your learning, and take responsibility for your growth. Leadership
and care go hand in hand but always remember to balance your responsibilities
and well-being. There are many paths to achieving your goals, so stay flexible
and determined.”</p>
<p>Putri’s story demonstrates that setbacks do not define one’s journey.
Through consistent effort, support from friends and mentors, and a commitment
to service and personal growth, she has transformed challenges into opportunities.
Her resilience and openness to alternative pathways show that success is
not a single destination but a journey with multiple routes to achievement.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Xin Yi’s four-year school journey has been defined by self-belief, determination,
and a commitment to learning from every experience. Achieving an EMB3 with
5 distinctions, Lim credits her success to consistent effort, a positive
mindset, and the willingness to learn from mistakes.</p>
<p>“Making mistakes isn’t entirely a bad thing,” she reflected. “It allows
us to understand what went wrong and improve, so we don’t repeat the same
errors next time.”</p>
<p>Like many students, Xin Yi faced moments of stress and self-doubt. She
admitted that she often set high expectations for herself, driven in part
by comparisons with peers in higher academic streams.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want people to think that being in the Normal (Technical) stream
meant we didn’t work hard,” she explained. While this mindset created pressure,
she gradually learned to focus on her own growth rather than external opinions,
prioritising her mental well-being alongside her academic goals.</p>
<p>Xin Yi’s leadership and contributions to the school community are equally
noteworthy. She served as CO Assistant Section Leader from 2023 to 2024
and as Chairperson from 2024 to 2025, demonstrating integrity, empathy,
and dedication. She was also a key member of the Claw Machine project at
D’Hangout, actively contributing to planning and execution. Teachers noted
that Lim consistently exhibited the school values of Honour and Humility,
leading with integrity, maintaining high standards, and ensuring that rehearsals
and activities were purposeful and well-organised.</p>
<p>Academically, Lim has combined her creativity with her discipline. Her
passion lies in the arts, and she has discovered a strong interest in the
field of Architecture. She is drawn to the field not only for her artistic
skills but also for the opportunity to bring imagination to life through
designing models and innovative structures. This interest reflects her
ability to blend technical skill with creative thinking — a hallmark of
her approach to learning and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Lim also emphasises the importance of resilience and balance. Her advice
to younger students reflects her personal philosophy: “Never give up, focus
on yourself, and most importantly, do not give yourself too much stress.
Don’t stress about things you cannot control.”</p>
<p>This outlook captures her journey — one in which she learned to navigate
academic pressure, set realistic personal goals, and maintain mental and
emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Lim is determined to pursue her dream of becoming an architect,
confident that her combination of creativity, discipline, and leadership
will help her succeed.</p>
<p>Her story is a reminder that success is built not only on talent but also
on persistence, self-reflection, and the ability to turn challenges into
opportunities for growth.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="2">
<p>Premeetha’s four-year school journey has been one of personal growth,
resilience, and discovery. Achieving an EMB3 of 5 distinctions, she describes
her results as the culmination of effort, perseverance, and the lessons
she learned along the way. “At first, my own expectations weighed me down,
but over time I realised the journey itself was amazing,” she reflected.</p>
<p>Throughout her years at school, Premeetha faced significant personal challenges.
She experienced discrimination and the emotional strain of her parents’
separation, which left her feeling isolated and overwhelmed at times. There
were days when she cried almost daily, struggling to cope. A turning point
came through conversations with the school counsellor, who helped her see
the importance of healthy distraction — redirecting her emotions through
meaningful engagement rather than running from her problems.</p>
<p>Inspired by this guidance, Premeetha became actively involved in school
initiatives. Taking on roles such as Chairperson of the Bracelet-Making
Workshop in 2022 and Chairperson of the Claw Machine Project in 2024, she
found purpose and a way to channel her energy productively. Participation
in these projects not only allowed her to contribute positively to the
school community but also helped her regain a sense of control over her
life. Through these experiences, Premeetha learned to focus on her well-being,
building confidence and emotional resilience.</p>
<p>Academically, Premeetha initially struggled to balance her commitments.
Juggling schoolwork with leadership roles and co-curricular responsibilities
often left her mentally and physically exhausted.</p>
<p>She candidly shared, “I was constantly tired, pushing myself even when
I had nothing left. Over time, I realised that giving my all doesn’t mean
sacrificing myself completely. I needed to manage my energy and set boundaries
to continue doing well both in my studies and in my projects.”</p>
<p>Teachers describe Premeetha as a student who embodies Honour and Humility.
She led with integrity, prioritising the growth and well-being of her peers
while maintaining high standards for herself. Her leadership was marked
by empathy and emotional intelligence, inspiring respect and encouraging
a culture of participation and appreciation for values-driven initiatives
across the school.</p>
<p>Premeetha’s academic achievements reflect her growth mindset and dedication.
She learned to approach challenges with patience, viewing mistakes as opportunities
to improve. Her advice to younger students emphasises this perspective:
“Never give up, focus on yourself, and enjoy what you do. Set high expectations,
but don’t let them overwhelm you. Learn to balance your responsibilities
and always prioritise your well-being.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Premeetha plans to pursue Business Administration, a course
that aligns with her strengths in communication and people-centred roles.
She recognises the importance of enjoying her studies while building skills
that will help her grow professionally. Her vision combines practical career
goals with a desire to continue developing herself personally and creatively.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her school journey, Premeetha notes how far she has come:
from a period of struggle and self-doubt to becoming a confident, accomplished,
and engaged student. Through perseverance, self-belief, and the support
of friends, teachers, and the school community, she has transformed challenges
into opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>Premeetha’s story is a reminder that success is not only measured by results
but also by the courage to face difficulties, the resilience to keep moving
forward, and the empathy to positively impact those around you.</p>
