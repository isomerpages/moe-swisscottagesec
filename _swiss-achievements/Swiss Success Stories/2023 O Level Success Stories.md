<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahmad Danial attributes his success to the unwavering support of friends
who stood by him during his time at Swiss. "Jing Xuan and Resshwin helped
me a lot, and I could never repay them enough," he acknowledges. Their
emotional and moral support, especially during the time he &nbsp;missed
school due to CCA commitments like the NSG, became invaluable. These friends
not only collected his school work but also shared their class notes and
dedicated extra hours to tutoring him, ensuring he stayed abreast of classroom
activities.</p>
<p>Ahmad Danial's success story is deeply intertwined with the humility and
gratitude he expresses towards his senior, Akhtar Javier (AJ). Throughout
the challenging period preceding prelims, AJ's mentorship became a pivotal
factor in Ahmad Danial's achievements. Gratefully acknowledging AJ's influence,
Ahmad Danial highlights the invaluable insights and study tips shared by
his senior, emphasizing the effectiveness of mind maps. AJ's motivational
words served as a source of inspiration, propelling Ahmad Danial to strive
for excellence in his O-levels. This narrative underscores Ahmad Danial's
humility in recognising the impact of others on his journey and his genuine
gratitude for the guidance he received.</p>
<p>Another crucial turning point occurred during a conversation with his
biology teacher, Mr. Goh Wei Bin. Discussions about tertiary education
choices shed light on the competitiveness and effort required for entry
into desired courses. This realisation spurred Ahmad Danial to intensify
his preparation for the O-levels, understanding the importance of dedicating
himself to his academic pursuits.</p>
<p>While navigating the challenging terrain of balancing CCA commitments
and academic responsibilities posed a significant hurdle for Ahmad Danial,
he did not give up. The National School Games overlapped with a weighted
assessment period, causing him to fall behind in his coursework. Despite
concerns raised by teachers, Ahmad Danial saw it as his responsibility
to cope with the workload, prioritising academic pursuits over CCA commitments
while seeking the time needed to catch up with his peers.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Ahmad Danial envisions a future in Nursing at Ngee Ann
Polytechnic. This choice aligns with his aspiration to delve into biomedical
science and serves as a stepping stone toward his dream of becoming a doctor.
He hopes this path allows him to apply his skills and knowledge effectively,
ultimately paving the way for entry into NUS.</p>
<p>In expressing his gratitude, Ahmad Danial acknowledges the endless support
from peers, teachers, and family members. His narrative, woven with gratitude
and resilience, serves as a testament to the power of support networks
in overcoming challenges and pursuing ambitious dreams. We extend our heartfelt
congratulations to Ahmad Danial and wish him continued success on his educational
journey and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Lam Jing Xuan (4S1)</strong>

<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>In a world often dominated by self-promotion, the humility exuded by Jing
Xuan in reflecting on his academic achievements stands out as a refreshing
change. Despite securing impressive O level results, Jing Xuan describes
the experience as nothing short of "surreal." This choice of words not
only communicates the magnitude of his success but also reveals a humble
mindset, where he does not boast about his accomplishments but instead
expresses disbelief.</p>
<p>Jing Xuan's humility takes a deeper turn as he openly acknowledges grappling
with self-doubt and fears of repeating past mistakes. This admission goes
beyond a mere acknowledgment of challenges; it showcases a genuine vulnerability,
emphasising that success is not always a straightforward journey, and even
high achievers face internal struggles.</p>
<p>The guiding philosophy imparted by his biology teacher, Mr. Goh Wei Bin,
adds another layer to Jing Xuan's humility. Embracing the idea that one
is "free to not do" things that don't contribute to learning underscores
a commitment to meaningful education over mere completion. This philosophy
reflects a mature understanding that true success lies not in the accumulation
of accolades but in continuous improvement and knowledge acquisition.</p>
<p>However, Jing Xuan doesn't attribute his success solely to his own efforts.
His humility extends to recognising the profound influence of his family,
particularly his grandparents. Instead of taking full credit for his hard
work and achievements, he humbly credits his family's resilience as a driving
force behind his commitment to excellence. This acknowledgment serves as
a testament to the importance of a supportive environment in fostering
success.</p>
<p>As he summarises his journey, Jing Xuan graciously attributes his achievements
to the collective effort of those around him. His statement, "the culmination
of the efforts from the people around me helping me," underscores a humility
that recognises the collaborative nature of success. In a society that
often glorifies individual accomplishments, Jing Xuan's humility serves
as a reminder that achievements are frequently the result of collective
support and effort.</p>
<p>In closing, we extend our best wishes to Jing Xuan for his future endeavours.
May his humble perspective continue to guide him on a path of continuous
growth and success, not just for himself but for the community that has
played a crucial role in shaping his journey.</p>

<p><strong>Tricia Tan En Qi (4S1)</strong>
</p>

<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the intricate mosaic of her post-secondary journey, Tricia, a resilient
and determined student, unravelled a tale characterised by a mix of happiness,
shock, and overwhelming relief. Securing admission into the desired polytechnic
course served as a testament to her dedication and hard work, leaving her
emotions in a state of triumphant flux.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her achievements, Tricia attributes her success to a combination
of personal resilience and unwavering support from significant figures
in her life. She recounts, "The first reason would be due to my resilience,
never giving up when the going gets tough." Despite facing challenges,
such as disappointing prelim scores, Tricia's determination prevailed.
She shares, "I did not do well during my prelims, but that did not stop
me from aspiring to get into the poly course (common business programme
in NP) that I wanted."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the pivotal role played by her support system, Tricia expresses
gratitude to her parents, and teachers, specifically mentioning Ms. Faith
and Mr. Tan, and friends. Their belief in her capabilities became a driving
force, propelling her towards excellence. Tricia emphasises the importance
of support, stating, "With their unwavering support and belief in me, it
propelled me to perform to the best of my ability."</p>
<p>Confronting a moment of shock and anxiety upon receiving the prelim results
that were not up to her expectation, Tricia describes it as a wakeup call.
She narrates, "This was the wakeup call that pushed me to review my studying
habits and study smart instead of harder." Embracing the Chinese motto
of 先苦后甜, which translates to "bitterness first, sweetness later," she found
motivation in the belief that hard work would eventually yield gratifying
results.</p>
<p>One of Tricia's greatest fears revolved around not meeting her expectations
in certain subjects. However, her parents provided valuable perspectives,
assuring her that life is full of unexpected surprises and disappointments.
Their advice to focus on diligent effort and continuous improvement resonates
with Tricia, who sees her O-level results not as an endpoint but as a stepping
stone for personal growth.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Tricia sets her sights on pursuing the Common Business
Programme at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, with aspirations to further her studies
in business at a local university, perhaps NUS. Grateful for the guidance
and support she received, Tricia extends her appreciation, stating, "I
would like to thank all my teachers and parents."</p>
<p>Tricia's narrative mirrors a journey of resilience, self-discovery, and
growth, offering a profound lesson in navigating challenges and celebrating
victories. Her story stands as a testament to the power of perseverance
and the transformative impact of a strong support network.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Tricia and wish her continued
success in her future endeavours!</p>

<p><strong>Nor Arleesha Binte Noor Azlan (4S4)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arleesha’s journey through the O level examinations was marked by an unexpected
blend of triumphs and challenges. While she had set her sights on achieving
B3 in English, the result was a commendable B4—an achievement that left
her with a sense of joy and accomplishment. Her disciplined approach to
studying, combined with an unwavering commitment to her goals, played a
pivotal role in her academic success.</p>
<p>However, Arleesha’s resilience was tested during the early days of Sec
3 when a medical condition, pulmonary embolism, emerged abruptly. This
challenging period began with hormone imbalances and a fractured ankle,
which led to the formation of blood clots in her heart and lungs. The consequences
were episodes of severe breathlessness and fainting, making each day a
test of her mental and physical strength.</p>
<p>The ICU became a temporary refuge for Arleesha, where she encountered
numerous needles, oxygen masks, and medical professionals. Despite the
fear and uncertainty, her determination and robust cardiovascular health,
developed through years of basketball training, became instrumental in
her recovery. The journey through this near-death experience not only highlighted
her resilience but also underscored the fragility of life, prompting Arleesha
to reflect on the importance of appreciating every moment.</p>
<p>Beyond the health challenges, Arleesha's academic resilience shone through.
Her story serves as a testament to facing unexpected obstacles with courage
and tenacity. Despite the setbacks, Arleesha's determination and commitment
to her studies remained unwavering. Her triumphant spirit in the face of
adversity is an inspiration, showcasing the remarkable strength she possesses.</p>
<p>As Arleesha embarks on her culinary journey at Temasek Polytechnic through
the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE), we celebrate her triumphs, not just
academically but also in overcoming life-altering challenges. Arleesha's
story is a beacon of resilience, reminding us all of the incredible power
within to navigate through the unexpected twists that life may present.</p>
<p>We wish her continued success and fulfilment in her academic pursuits.</p>

<p><strong>Ng Xin Tong (4S8)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the tapestry of her secondary school years, Xin Tong, a determined
and resilient student, wove a story of dedication and self-discovery. Balancing
academic rigour and personal well-being became the cornerstone of her final
year, a testament to her evolving journey.</p>
<p>Listening attentively in every lesson and seeking guidance from teachers,
Xin Tong recalls, "The result I have obtained is what I have expected,
and I’m absolutely fine with it." Her hard work throughout the initial
years set the stage for a fulfilling conclusion, marked by a newfound equilibrium
between studies and relaxation.</p>
<p>The turning point occurred as Xin Tong, inspired by witnessing her seniors'
joy during results day, made a pivotal decision: "I decided to work hard,
hoping to leave a mark for my juniors too." This determination stemmed
from a desire to experience the same happiness and fulfilment in her academic
achievements.</p>
<p>Recalling her early challenges with the English language in her first
year, Xin Tong reflects, "I can only use ‘broken’ English to communicate
with others," highlighting the initial feelings of isolation. Yet, her
schoolmates' support and kindness were instrumental: "My schoolmates were
so helpful and supportive that motivated me to enjoy my life in Swiss."
This transformative experience led to not only adaptation but also the
formation of enduring friendships.</p>
<p>With a clear vision for the future, Xin Tong aspires to pursue a career
in accountancy: "Business analyst or financial auditor or actuary." Her
ambitions reflect a profound understanding of her strengths and interests,
solidifying her commitment to continued growth and success.</p>
<p>Sharing her insights, Xin Tong leaves a resonant piece of advice: "There
is no end to our life. If you try to improve yourself throughout your life
without feeling enough of what you have done, then there is always something
in a higher level that you can obtain." Her journey from Normal(Technical)
to Normal(Academic) to Express stream embodies this philosophy, encouraging
both parents and students to embrace a mindset of perpetual self-improvement
and resilience.</p>
<p>Xin Tong's story reflects dedication, resilience, and growth, inspiring
all of us to do better. We wish her all the best for her future endeavours!</p>

</p>

recounted a mix of relief and a touch of disappointment. Grateful for his
hard work paying off and securing a score that opens doors to various courses
and JCs, he remains modest, acknowledging he fell just a point short of
his targeted JC-required score of 9.</p>
<p>In Ming Dong's journey, determination plays a significant role, helping
him persevere through setbacks during O level preparation. He shares, "Determination

focusing on productive sessions while putting aside distractions.</p>
<p>Facing initial fears and scepticism about his O level performance, Ming
Dong chooses humility over surrender. He challenges fate and shifts his
mindset to focus on the learning process rather than just final results.

to a Junior College (JC) situated in the western part of Singapore, such
as Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JP), Anderson Serangoon Junior College
(AC), or River Valley High School (RV), ultimately aiming for Nanyang Business
School to pursue a degree in Business Administration.</p>

form teacher of four years, Ms. Tan Mee Han, for unwavering support during
moments of panic about prelim results. He acknowledges her reassurance
as a source of calm and encouragement throughout his O level preparation
journey.</p>
<p>Ming Dong's narrative is an authentic tale of resilience, determination,
and humility—a reminder that success often accompanies challenges and a
down-to-earth willingness to learn.</p>

pursuits!</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite not achieving the exact score he aimed for, Jun Chao finds satisfaction
in his accomplishments. He attributes a significant part of his success
to discipline, recognising its importance in navigating the challenges
of Secondary 5, where independence becomes paramount. Jun Chao shares,
"Choosing to take the route to Secondary 5 means that we should be more
independent. I allocated self-study time during school and after school
to get work done."</p>
<p>The turning point in Jun Chao's journey came after receiving his prelim
results. Disappointed but undeterred, he saw it as a sign to work harder.
He reflects, "I dedicated more time after school to do self-study as well
as asking for consultations during the study break period to catch up on
subjects I was weak in." The caring spirit of his teachers became a source
of motivation, propelling him to redouble his efforts towards his goals.</p>
<p>Navigating the challenges of a fast-paced curriculum, Jun Chao, also a
CCA Leader in Scouts, emphasised the importance of time management. "There
were a lot of chapters to take in, and lessons were going at a fast pace.

schoolwork and CCA completed." Seeking advice from seniors on effective
task management, he created a schedule to balance his responsibilities.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the realm of his secondary school journey, Ivo, a passionate and determined
individual, paints a canvas of emotions, from the initial paranoia to the
ultimate euphoria upon receiving his O-level results. As the veil of anticipation
lifted, the culmination of years of hard work and dedication manifested
in a moment that felt different, evoking both happiness for the respectable
results and a tinge of sadness as his Swiss journey concluded.</p>
<p>Approaching the results table alongside his form teachers, Mrs. Fan Sook
Theng and Mr. Eric Lee, who played pivotal roles in shaping his educational
foundation, Ivo reminisces, "They are just two of the people who helped
me build my educational foundation. I couldn't thank both Mrs. Fan and
Mr. Eric any more than I possibly could." The rollercoaster of emotions
shifted from fear and anxiety to pure joy, marking a unique turning point
in his academic journey.</p>
<p>The success Ivo achieved is intricately woven into the fabric of his relationships—with
family, friends, and teachers. Expressing gratitude, he acknowledges, "My
family has not only supported me financially, but they have also encouraged
me through my endeavours and given me much support." His friends, a constant
presence throughout his secondary school years, served as a wellspring
of inspiration, exposing him to diverse experiences that shaped his future
prospects.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the immense support from teachers, Ivo emphasizes their
role in his success, stating, "The whole reason I am able to even do this
well for my O-levels is thanks to all of them." From educational guidance
to emotional support, the teachers became invaluable pillars in his journey.</p>
<p>In the transformative year of 2023, Ivo's conversation with a close friend
unravelled new perspectives on life and the workforce. The insights gained
sparked a passion and realization that transcended education alone. Reflecting
on this, he shares, "It was all tiny moments that helped me realise all
I needed to strive in the world, not only education."</p>
<p>Facing a mountain of stress, particularly due to having only five subjects
and the pressure of achieving a stellar L1R4 score, Ivo confronted the
challenge head-on. Despite anxiety and immense stress, he found solace
in the belief that life extends beyond the immediate hurdles of education.
His mental fortitude overpowered the inclination to give up, a triumph
that fills him not just with gratitude but genuine happiness.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Ivo plans to pursue an IT course, drawn to the field's
constant challenges. Describing himself as a person who thrives best when
faced with challenges, he aspires to be a data analyst or a coder, relishing
the limitless possibilities that technology offers.</p>
<p>Ivo’s journey, as vividly depicted, speaks volumes, echoing the sentiments
of resilience, gratitude, and a bright future filled with limitless possibilities.
