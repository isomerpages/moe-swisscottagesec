<h1>2023 N Level Success Stories</h1><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Aniq_Hariss_Bin_Shrajudin__4S1_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Aniq Hariss Bin Shrajudin [4S1]</strong></p><p>Reflecting on his good results, Aniq expressed a profound sense of happiness, attributing it to his unwavering dedication and hard work. "I was happy about my results because I worked really hard for it," he shared, embodying the satisfaction that comes from diligent effort.</p><p>The thoughtful and considerate student demonstrated a deep sense of respect for both teachers and peers.He also contributed actively to the school as the Vice-President of the Student Council and a member of the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). He exhibited an unwavering commitment to responsibility in tasks assigned, and in doing so epitomised the school value of honour. He also displayed humility through a keen focus on enhancing personal learning, showcasing respect in his interactions with others.</p><p>One of the pivotal reasons for Aniq's holistic achievements can be attributed to the support of his family and friends.&nbsp; In moments of self-doubt, his parents and friends provided reassurance, encouraging him to excel.</p><p>Another factor is the strength of faith Aniq had in himself and the school. Despite suggestions for additional tuition outside of school, Aniq's trust in his school's quality education led him to seek guidance and consultations from his dedicated teachers. Stepping out of his comfort zone, he actively sought consultations to bridge the gaps in his understanding, emphasising his commitment to academic improvement. Moreover, his friends played an integral role by aiding him in areas where he required assistance, fostering a collaborative learning environment.</p><p>While it is easy to admire his academic success as well as his all-round contributions, Aniq’s journey was not devoid of challenges. For example, Aniq lived in the heartlands of Punggol.&nbsp; The extensive distance between home and school had presented a significant obstacle, limiting his study time.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this practical difficulty, Aniq's main solution to overcome the stresses posed by heavily reduced personal study time lay in disciplined time management. Maximising his commute by studying on the way to school and dedicating his weekends to focused study sessions became his routine. He also reached out for&nbsp; solace and encouragement in the unwavering support of his loved ones. Ever grateful, Aniq acknowledged his grandparents for their invaluable support, allowing him to stay closer to school during examination periods, ensuring he could reach school on time for his papers.</p><p>Another defining reason that fueled Aniq's determination to excel was rooted in his desire to enter the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP). His ambition to enter PFP was fuelled by his wish to circumvent the need to travel back and forth another year, in Secondary 5.</p><p>“Getting into PFP would be a double bonus. I’ll get to pursue the course I really want to study. And I can stop having to travel for so long every day,” aa iq reasoned.</p><p>Aniq envisions a career in medicine, influenced by his grandparents' frequent health struggles. Driven by a desire to reciprocate the care and support they provided him, he aspires to become a doctor, aiming to alleviate their suffering and help others in similar situations.</p><p>Aniq's story stands as a testament to perseverance, family support, and determination, showcasing that despite challenges, with unwavering dedication and a strong support system, achieving academic excellence remains within reach.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nur_Hidayah_Binte_Mohd_Jumari__4S1_.jpg"></div><p></p><p><strong>Nur Hidayah Binte Mohd Jumari [4S1]</strong></p><p>Hidayah had a passion for Principles of Accounting. Her love and aptitude for the subject made her attain a distinction for the subject.</p><p>“I started to work hard after realising that I had not much time. I took the term assessments (WA) a little lightly,” she recalled.</p><p>She shared how her Prelim results made her&nbsp; realise that she had little time to catch up.</p><p>“I needed 1 to 2 hours per topic and&nbsp; wondered how I could possibly finish revision on time,” she explained. “Then I decided to get advice from Mdm Aishah. During Biology class, Mdm Aishah had taught us ways of how to write Biology notes. I found creating my notes helpful and so, I tried to write notes for every subject. It was a more effective and time-efficient way to revise the many chapters I needed to know,” she explained with some satisfaction.</p><p>Another driving factor that made her determined is the need to prove a few people wrong. Along the way, she started feeling judged by certain individuals whom she declined to name. She admitted that this was an indirect feeling for they did not say anything specifically hurtful to her.</p><p>In hindsight, she thinks that final examinations get competitive and sometimes the competitiveness to get to the next level did get to her and affected her own self-belief.</p><p>“Eventually, I realised that I needed to work hard not for others, but for myself,” shared a wiser Hidayah.</p><p>Having come very far, Hidayah now has some key decisions to make.</p><p>“I’m thrilled that I got a Grade 1 for POA. But I’m not I’m not satisfied with the Grade 4 for English Language.”</p><p>Hidayah is now concerned that a Grade 4 in EL&nbsp; has placed a limit on her wish to do PFP - which requires that she has a minimum attainment of B3 for the English Language.</p><p>Hidayah is still considering a route that will take her to doing Accounting in the future.</p><p>“I'll appeal and if necessary, I'll re-evaluate what I want to do. I guess there are other options,” she said reflectively.</p><p>{INSERT Values and leadership qualities)</p><p>To do well in the future so I can feel satisfied with my points.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let competitiveness get the better of you.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nur_Shamirha_Binte_Mohamad_Shairani__4S2_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Nur&nbsp; Shamirha Binte Mohamad Shairani [4S2]</strong></p><p>Shamirha recalls how when she had received her PSLE results, she ‘saw’ the disappointment in her mother’s eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>“She never said anything to me directly. I guess she knew how I must be feeling and did not want to make me feel worse. Her sensitivity to my feelings and her goodwill for my future made me want to do my best in secondary school.”</p><p>Now, a&nbsp; jubilant Shamirha received her N level results with joy.</p><p>“I’ve never felt happier in my life. I’m grateful that the hard work that I have put in academically has paid off with these amazing results. I remember the amount of times I had shed tears just thinking about all the “what if’s,” she shared emotionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A key reason behind Shamirha’s resolve to succeed was her regard for her mother, and her desire to see her “mother’s proud eyes.” Being the main caregiver, her mother deeply wanted Shamirha to have better options than she had had.</p><p>Her drive to make her mother proud saw a transformation in her learning habits. From being fairly laid-back the way she used to be in primary school, Shamhira found herself working hard, often receiving coaching from her sister. For the first time in her life, she passed her Math in Sec 1 at the very first Weighted Assessment (WA1). Her mother’s quiet happiness and her immediate success fuelled her desire to keep going.</p><p>Well, Shamirha has a huge reservoir of resilience and is known to have the resolve to&nbsp; face challenging situations with an admirable sense of positivity. A proactive learner who has been receptive to feedback, she pursued her personal growth by an openness to self-improvement and humility. This extended to all areas of learning and was especially evident during the SYF period. As a leader, she served with honour as the Head of Swiss Dance (Malay Dance), displaying a strong sense of responsibility in all the tasks assigned to her.</p><p>Interestingly, even for the diligent Shamirha, the final lap in Secondary 4 was eventful. She went through a “sloppy” and “lazy” stage where she held back from being fully participative academically.</p><p>"I think I got complacent or burnt-out after 3 years of working hardand constantly striving to make improvements. I think I didn’t take enough breaks. It was as if I had a mental block,” she explained. “One day during Science class, I just found myself not understanding anything anymore.”</p><p>Fortunately with a dreary set of Prelim results, she changed her mindset again.&nbsp; More importantly, she reached out to family, friends and teachers for support. They were puzzled at this change in her behaviour but continued to encourage her. She learnt to work in healthy breaks between studying. Her strong foundation over the previous three years also expedited her getting back on track.</p><p>Now, a happy Shamirha looks forward to taking Bio-Chemical Technology in the Polytechnic.</p><p>“I want to be a Toxicologist,” she quipped, and this time, the dream is hers, backed by a proud mother.</p><p>We are proud of you and happy for you too, Shamirha!</p><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Hillary_Kee__4S3_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Hillary Kee [4S3]</strong></p><p>Her teachers and friends described her as a consistently diligent and cheerful student who honoured all her tasks and assignments. And so, her good performance came as no surprise to most people. After all, she would even wake up early on the weekends to spend time studying in the Upper Secondary years.</p><p>To make herself comfortable and to vary her experience, she even used studypods which she found to be “most conducive”.</p><p>Hillary shared some of her love for studying with a laugh, “I just discovered ways to enjoy studying. It’s essential to find joy in learning. For example, I found using colours and small doodles really helpful. It kept me from burn out.”</p><p>According to Hillary, her friends and family had also always reminded her to not be too hard on herself.</p><p>“Seeing my friends score well and seeing them study would motivate me to work harder to score better. And every time I felt like I'm lagging behind in terms of understanding a topic, I'd go and read up on it more and make notes to ensure that I understood&nbsp; what was&nbsp; going on in class.”</p><p>Hillary felt that in this context, their constant encouragement had helped her to reduce the pressure she had placed on herself.</p><p>In&nbsp; many ways, she deserved to feel super delighted at her results and she shared her reactions quite openly.</p><p>“I was ecstatic when I received my results,” beamed Hillary, “But I had a nagging worry that the actual national examinations papers I had taken may not have reflected my best output.”</p><p>Hillary had deep reasons to be anxious about her results. Things were not always smooth or upbeat for Hillary in her graduating year. Right before the preliminary examinations, she had experienced the loss of her elder brother who had been very close to her.. This tragic turn of events had a deep impact on her cheerful self.</p><p>“I struggled to cope with my studies and my mental health because his death was unexpected,” she shared and added, “I lost a person who guided me and that was very hard to accept.”</p><p>Fortunately for Hillary, she was blessed with a very supportive circle of friends and family. During this very traumatic period, Hillary reflected on how she continued to findI great support and understanding from the school, family and friends.</p><p>“In turn, focussing on studies helped me with an outlet to manage my mental state and handle my emotions.”</p><p>Hillary plans to take psychology in Temasek Polytechnic as she is keenly interested in the Social Sciences and wants to focus mainly on the behaviours and development of children.</p><p>“I thinks that many children may struggle to express themselves clearly,” she shared.&nbsp; “A strong circle of people is important for everyone because sometimes, we just need that care and understanding to pull us through unexpected setbacks.”</p><p>We wish Hillary every step of success.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Tiara_Khairyne_Binte_Mohamad_Khairuddin__4S3_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Tiara Khairyne Binte Mohamad Khairuddin [4S3]</strong></p><p>Tiara served as Vice-chairperson of the Swiss Malay Dance Club and displayed exemplary character and leadership. A role-model, she had received the Ministry of Education Character Award (ECHA) three times,&nbsp; in 2021, 2022 and 2023. She demonstrated an unwavering determination to succeed in all her endeavours and consistently gave her best in everything she undertook. In turn, her peers felt comfortable approaching her with their concerns and accepted her leadership. Besides honouring her responsibilities, she also exhibited humility by displaying a genuine willingness to listen to others' opinions - which helped her make commendable progress.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked how she felt about her N level results, Tiara shared with her characteristic self-effacing humility that she was surprised.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to pass the subjects that I was always weak in, like Science and Mathematics. I actually ended up getting a Grade 3 in English Language, Science and Mathematics at the N levels,” she shared happily, and then added, “And this is much better than my performance in secondary school since my Sec 1 days. I have always failed Math and Science. I barely passed the English Language.”</p><p>Tiara’s story is an inspiring tale of perseverance. How did she do it?</p><p>"I think it is so critical to have the right people around you to give you support and motivation. Friends who push you to do better.”</p><p>Tiara explained how words of encouragement mattered very much to her. When her friends reassured her when she did not do well, it made her want to continue pushing herself - though she was by nature already hardworking.&nbsp;</p><p>“Parents. Teachers. Friends. When they believe in me, they give me hope. On top of their encouraging words, when I did badly for my timed practice and had difficulties answering the questions, just a few days before the actual N level examinations I asked my friends for help. I just kept asking questions until I fully understood it."</p><p>Tiara had learnt to hold on to the value of perseverance from Primary School, something that her then Math teacher from the Primary School had always told her. Interestingly, despite her continued struggle with Math, the words of her primary school Math teacher continued to reverberate and finally, she tasted the much awaited fruits of her labour.</p><p>“Perseverance has helped me make progress - nevertheless. I never stopped trying and today I can celebrate because I scored a Grade 3. My next goal would be to improve this Grade in my post-secondary course of study. I am thrilled.”</p><p>Tiara is now wondering if she should pursue a course on Early Childhood Education or Tourism. “I want to help others. I love teaching younger children and I got to try teaching when as part of my CCA-VIA experience as a member of the Malay Dance group, we decided to organise some lessons for preschool children," recalled a satisfied Tiara.</p><p>We wish her all the best!</p><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Ang_Shi_Ting_Cheryl__4S7_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Ang Shi Ting Cheryl [4S7]</strong></p><p>Cheryl had scored a total of four distinctions for her N level subjects, excluding the O level Humanities that she will receive the results for in January 2024. Strong foundations in every subject was a key reason for her stellar performance because she had continually&nbsp; built on what she already knew.</p><p>“I knew which subjects I needed more time to improve on. With this step, improvement in my overall performance was easier.”</p><p>She added that her peers were a strong source of support and also pace-setting. She shared that when she studied with her classmates, there were many instances when her classmates knew the answers to some questions that she did not know. These moments fuelled the need to work even&nbsp; harder to achieve mastery.</p><p>Exhibiting the school value of Honour, Cheryl was described as resilient and adaptable, when facing challenges.&nbsp; Her teachers recalled her commendable diligence, meticulous attention to detail and unwavering determination in both her&nbsp; academic and CCA pursuits. In fact, Cheryl was the String's Section Leader in Chinese Orchestra and a member of the Student Council. She demonstrated respect with a sensitive and tactful approach when interacting with both her peers and teachers. This posture of humility made her a likeable and effective leader.</p><p>“I know I have done well in many subjects and contributed my leadership but I do feel disappointed because my English Language (EL) result is a Grade 4. This setback means I cannot qualify for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP),” she explained in a mix of pensive and matter-of-fact tone.</p><p>Her English Language proficiency had been a glaring issue. She explained that her basics in the English Language such as its&nbsp; grammar and vocabulary were weak or flawed. Over the years, as the English language demands intensified, she found it more and more difficult to strengthen her English competency to match increasing requirements.&nbsp; Cheryl dearly wished she could have overcome this gap. She had even explored tuition, and&nbsp; English Language being the only subject she had engaged a tutor for.</p><p>The level-headed Cheryl is now exploring the DPP route. She feels that though the pathway to the Polytechnic may now be longer, the DPP option nevertheless offers her a way forward to explore courses that are related to Accountancy. She reflected that she had done well in Principles of Accounting as well as Mathematics. Hence, her long-term goal does not have to be deterred by this setback.</p><p>“I am also considering Early Childhood Education because I do enjoy interacting with children,” she quipped. Though she wished that her results gave her a more straightforward way forward, she is cognizant that she has many options ahead of her. Whatever the pathway Cheryl picks, she knows that she will continue to build on her existing knowledge and skills. <br><br>“In spite of challenges and setbacks, don't give up so easily!” is what she has to say to her juniors.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Muhammad_Danize_Bin_Nor_Muhammad_Bolkiah__4S7_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Muhammad Danize Bin Nor Muhammad Bolkiah [4S7]</strong></p><p>Danize embodies a persona of humility and determination, exemplifying the virtues of hard work, dedication. Despite achieving an exceptional result of 4 distinctions, his demeanour remained grounded.</p><p>“I feel very satisfied, happy, and shocked as my hard work paid off," he shared, reflecting the culmination of his efforts. Danize’s words expressed a blend of satisfaction, happiness, and astonishment.</p><p>Behind this remarkable achievement lie pivotal factors that contributed to Danize's success. He emphasised the crucial role of his supportive teachers and friends. In particular, Danize acknowledged Mr. Timothy Tan, whose encouragement and guidance played a pivotal role in achieving an 'A' grade in Science. This support system played a significant role in motivating and propelling Danize toward excellence.</p><p>Reflecting on his journey, Danize recounted a turning point that ignited his drive to excel. After witnessing a significant improvement in his grades following dedicated study sessions post-prelims, he made a conscious decision to reduce his football playtime and intensify his focus on academics. This shift in priorities was driven by the tangible progress he experienced through his hard work.</p><p>However, Danize's path was not without challenges. He shared that managing time effectively had been his greatest hurdle. Balancing his dedication to football while maintaining academic excellence proved daunting. This sense of conflict&nbsp; in managing time heightened after he found that he had underperformed in an assessment. This setback instilled a fear that he might not be able to do well academically in future assessments as well. To counter this sense of self-doubt, Danize resolved to revise consistently and gradually, and in time, he reclaimed control over his academic responsibilities.</p><p>Looking ahead now, Danize aspires to pursue Mechanical Engineering, driven by a lifelong passion for building and repairing things. Additionally, his keen interest in sports motivated him to explore Sports Management, leveraging his athletic abilities and curiosity to deepen his understanding of sports dynamics.</p><p>Ever the grateful student, Danize shared his words of thanks for those who helped him.</p><p>"I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my teachers, parents, and friends for their unwavering support in both my academic pursuits and athletic endeavours.”</p><p>Danize’s story definitely serves to inspire all in Swiss to overcome obstacles through determination and focused efforts. We wish him all the best!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>
