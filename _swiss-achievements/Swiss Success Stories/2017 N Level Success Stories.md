| #<br>Shabrose (top left picture) was a very quiet and reserved girl in lower secondary. She struggled academically at first but did not give up. A key reason for this resilience was the effect of school activities she experienced such as the Cambodia trip.<br>In 2016, Shabrose went with her classmates on an overseas VIA trip to Cambodia. This project required them to raise sufficient funds, plan and prepare materials to teach the children living within the slums. She taught the children a creative way of turning their old t-shirts into bags. Even though the environment of the slums was not what she was used to, Shabrose focussed on the trip’s purpose and maintained her enthusiasm for the project. She found a deeper sense of motivation to succeed in life.<br>Subsequently, during her graduating year in 2017, Shabrose’s increased commitment to her academics did not stop her from participating in another VIA project. Together with her classmates, they planned and executed a program for the elderly from the Lions Befrienders. Also as a member of the school Choir, she was involved in a number of performances. She practised hard and her performances received good feedback, thanks to the effort that she and the choir had put in.<br>In all, the improvement she achieved for Mathematics was especially notable. She improved from a ‘U’ grade in Sec 2 to an ‘A’ for preliminary examinations this year. It is also heartening to note that her social network expanded and she opened up to her classmates. She scored distinctions for both Math and Science, and a B for Computer Applications in the N level examination. Her dream is to work in the finance industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| #<br><br>Jess regards herself as a student who was once “playful and rebellious”, especially in the Lower Secondary. She blamed it on being oblivious to the consequences such callousness could have on her future. Despite the slight decline in her academic results in Secondary Two, she managed to pick up soon after through her hard work and perseverance. Jess regularly arranged consultation sessions with her various subject teachers to improve her grades for the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Normal (Technical) Level Examination in her graduating year.<br>She is thankful to teachers like Mr Den Lim and Mr Timothy Tan, who constantly reminded her of the need to do better. They offered to coach her despite their busy schedules.  She knew that she had trouble understanding Math questions or recalling critical scientific facts because of her weak English. Though slowed down by her language challenges, she continued to seek clarification and strove for mastery of the different subjects.<br>Jess also contributed to Swiss by representing the school in the West Zone Inter-School Floorball Competition from 2014 to 2015 – with commendable results. She also took part in the Horizon Trip to Cambodia to teach the children in one of the orphanages there how to make handbags from old clothing and in assisting the construction work of a pavement leading to the orphanage.<br>Jess managed to attain a ‘C’ for English and Science in the Preliminary Examinations but she did not stop there. She continued to double her efforts and scored a distinction for Science and a B for Mathematics in the N level examination. Moved by the help she had received from her own teachers, Jess now wants to pursue a career in Early Childhood Education so that she can help children.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

She also gained eligibility for transfer into the Normal (Academic) course.<br> “I feel very thrilled by my results. I didn’t have much confidence but I am very thankful as all my hard work had paid off.” She especially struggled with Mathematics though she knew of its importance in helping her access certain courses in ITE. She had never passed the subject since primary school. However, unlike in the past, this year, she mustered sufficient courage and approached her teachers to clarify her doubts in the various subjects. The seeds of hard work and sheer determination definitely bore fruit.<br>Besides striving academically, Aaliyah enjoyed a holistic school experience, including opportunities to lead her peers. She was a member of the Swiss Falcon Scout Troop since 2014 and juggled the responsibilities of being a Patrol Leader from 2016. She was part of the team that attained the Frank Coopers’ Sands Gold Award for Unit Performance in 2016 and in 2015 as well as the Silver Award for the Singapore Scouts Association National Patrol Camp in 2015. Aaliyah was also actively involved in activities such as the Green Movement and Love Your School Project and JuniorCare.<br>She worked hard in every area also because it was important for her to make her parents and teachers happy. “I felt that I didn’t appreciate the people around me enough. I have a teacher who is always there for me and supportive family members. Mdm Nisa helped me so much. She stayed back after school every day with to help me with my studies, in Mathematics and Science. She never failed to motivate me and push me beyond my comfort zone.”<br>Aaliyah has much to think about now. More academic pathways are open to her. Whichever route her decides to take, she knows that eventually, she wants to go to the Polytechnic to learn more – especially about Food Science.<br>                                                             |

| #<br>He was unmotivated and academically at risk from Sec 1 to 3. Li Sheng explained that he did not see the relevance of hard work or of studying at that time. The need for good academic results did not seem like an immediate concern.  But he made a remarkable turnaround this year after much persuasion by parents and teachers.  He became focussed and worked with such diligence that it did not go unnoticed by peers and teachers alike.<br>“My family started to pressurise me to work hard as this was the final lap of the four years here. I did not want to be the only son in the family to disappoint my parents.” For Li Sheng, the greatest wish he had was that his resolution to improve his grades could have come slightly earlier. He recalled, “As I started to prepare for the examinations, I was failing multiple subjects. I had a lot to catch up on.”<br>Besides his commitment to academic excellence, Li Sheng had been a reliable and approachable member of the Swiss Falcon Scout Troop. He represented the troop in the National Patrol Camp in 2016. He was part of the team that achieved the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award in 2015 and 2016, making it the Unit’s tenth consecutive Gold Award leading to its highest accolade, The Honours Pennant. On top of all his CCA contributions, Li Sheng was also active in contributing to society and took part in various activities like the Swiss Green Movement, the Junior Care project and the Food Centre Return Tray campaign.<br>With consistent effort in all areas, Li Sheng achieved many goals. He achieved distinctions for at least three subjects in the GCE N level examination. With the good results he has achieved, Li Sheng has more pathways for his future.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| #<br>Su Qi (right of picture) is the Vice President of the Student Council, a supportive classmate and also the Vice Chairperson in Malay Dance Club. A reflective leader, she would remain positive and composed in the face of challenges. She was a good role model for the student councillors and they looked up to her. She never hesitated to clarify her doubts in her school work. An interesting fact about Su Qi was her choice of CCA. Though she learnt Chinese Dance in primary school, she chose Malay Dance as her CCA in secondary school because she wanted to explore other genres of dance and to sharpen her repertoire of skills. Su Qi enjoyed challenges and viewed them as opportunities for self-improvement.<br>Behind this successful and cheerful front was a student who was juggling her school commitments with significant challenges in the home-front. She was able to overcome stress and trying situations, because she made decisions to simply move on. Her moments of reflection had put forth before her what was urgent or important versus what was not urgent or unimportant.

| #<br>Kar Mun (left of picture) was laterally transferred from the Normal (Technical) to the Normal (Academic) course at Sec 3. She took on the challenges of a faster academic track through sheer hard work. She scored three distinctions in the GCE N level examination with a Grade 4 for English Language. Though the result meant that she will not qualify for the Polytechnic, Kar Mun still has much to celebrate.<br>“I was stunned when I was told that I had three distinctions. All the hard work had paid off. When I was offered the lateral transfer, many people warned me that the Normal (Academic) course would be difficult. But I really wanted to try it to make my parents proud of me,” she smiled.<br>Kar Mun indeed had challenges – a new learning environment with friends and four new subjects. She tried to study everything on her own but eventually started to seek help. She found that asking questions and being personally coached helped her cut short the time taken to master the new subjects. Eventually, she also engaged tutors so that she could have even more control over her learning needs.  These were decisions she made on own. It also helped that she made it a point to be highly engaged during all school lessons.<br>It is also noteworthy that besides working hard academically, Kar Mun also gave of her best in CCA. She was a Cornet player of the Singapore National Cadet Corp (NCC) Command Band Swiss Winds from 2013 to 2017. By the end of her final year, she held the rank of Second Sergeant. She contributed to the band’s outstanding performance at various competitions and public performances, which includes the Opening Ceremony for the 28th SEA Games in 2015, the Lions Club Annual Charity Dinner, the Singapore Civil Defence Force Parade in 2016, the Swiss Arts Expressions Concert in 2016 and more. She also dedicated long hours to the support of NCC HQ events like the Change of Command Parade in 2016, the Civilian War Memorial for the remembrance ceremony in 2017, 2016 and 2014.<br>Kar Mun plans to complete her GCE O levels and go on to the Polytechnics, to pursue a course in the Bio Medical area. |
