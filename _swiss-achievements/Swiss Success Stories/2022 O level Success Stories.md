# 2022 O-level Success Stories


<img src="/images/Swiss%20Achievements/Swiss%20Success%20Stories/2022%20O%20Level%20Success%20Stories/Bong-Xin-Ying-Dione.jpeg" style="width:20%;float:left"><br clear="left">

**Bong Xin Ying Dione (S5N2)**

Dione expressed a huge sense of satisfaction with her results. She scored 13 points, making her eligible for both the Polytechnic and Junior College route.

As the Vice Captain for Badminton, Dione exhibited the school value of Honour in the way she showed her commitment and inspired respect from her peers and juniors. Despite having been excused from CCA sessions due to her back injury, she continued to support the running of CCA in other less physically demanding areas. She was also humble in the way she worked to make personal improvements in managing the increased academic rigour at 5N.

Looking back, Dione shared how she had entered Sec 5 with a heavy heart, because she had missed the Polytechnic Foundation Course because she scored a B4 for English Language. She admitted to feeling some worry about not being able to manage the O levels because she has heard that there is a “big jump from N to O level”. But thanks to the people around her, like her friends, teachers and family, she came to see that the Sec 5 route is not a terrible journey. And along the way, her teachers like Ms Ng Poh Keow also did not give up on her when she scored F9 for Additional Mathematics.

“Ms Ng took time out to explain the questions to me,” she shared, grateful for all the support.

The experience of sitting for the GCE O levels also came with a surprising turn of events because nothing could have prepared her for the surreal experience of missing GCE O level papers. Dione had become unwell for a good number of days during the GCE O levels. She suddenly tested Covid positive, much to her shock and worry.

“The first day that I was down with Covid was bad. I had no energy. But I just wanted a quick recovery to move on,” she remembered.  She vividly recalled missing three to four days of school at a go during the GCE O level examination period. “I missed my Biology and Social Studies paper,” she explained.

The Singapore Examination and Assessment Board called up her Preliminary Examination scores, along with those of several other candidates, in order to project her likely performance. But her Preliminary examinations results, taken before she had fully mastered all that she studied, were mediocre. She shared that she could not help feeling a deep sense of disappointment and frustration at losing the opportunity to know how she would have done, had she sat for the papers herself. In fact, she had studied even harder than she had done for the N levels the year before, and that must still have mattered much.

Looking back at her own journey, Dione’s message to students in the 4N course who worry that they may come back to 5N or those who do, is that the 5N journey can be memorable and bearable. What makes the difference that that one focuses on what one needs to do. And yes, time flies.

Dione, who enjoy the Sciences, is now considering courses in both the Polytechnic or the Junior College. Well, she has a happy problem now and we wish her all the best!

**Jolin Xu Kai Qian (S4E1)**

A dedicated member and the Principal player for liu qin in the Chinese Orchestra, Jolin achieved a commendable score of 7 points, which would open many doors for her post-secondary education. But she could not help but wish for that slight difference in results that would have been the “perfect” sum of the dedication with which she had applied herself.

“I feel disappointed with my Humanities. I scored an A2 but I really had expected an A1,” she stated matter-of-factly.

An all-rounded student, Jolin was described by her teachers as an individual who epitomized Honour in the way she carried out her duties. She constantly ensured that work assigned was done to the best of her ability. She also displayed compassion in the way she cared for her peers by looking out for them and providing support and encouragement to them whenever the need arose.

When asked how she managed to keep tabs on all areas of learning, Jolin was candid in pointing out that she was consistent and punctual in finishing her assignments – and always to the best of her abilities. Even so, there were moments when setbacks teach important messages.

Besides the value of high quality, diligence and time-management were twin lessons that she uncovered when she collected her Secondary 1 WA1 results. Underestimating the jump from four core subjects at the primary level to ten varied subjects and disciplinary modes at the secondary level, Jolin did not really study to master her learning and fell behind.

“To be honest, I never studied in primary school. And so, I was shocked that I didn’t do as well as I expected to do. It was a wakeup call!”

Jolin learnt that she would have to work hard to achieve the things that she wanted. The minor setback motivated her to developing better study habits like planning to learn in bite-size quantities and the importance of consistency in developing better working memory and deep understanding while reducing stress.

Jolin’s greatest challenge was managing her own performance anxiety. It caused much self-doubt and resulted in her studying till late at night or waking up rather early to study. These unhealthy habits affected her ability to focus during tests and also weakened her body. Fortunately, she learnt over time to sleep earlier to feel fresh the next day. Along with better focus consistent practices and good social support, she started developing confidence and results, moving into a positive cycle of effort and results.

“Studying one week before the waited assessment will not help me achieve the results,” she quipped. “And not sleeping enough takes a toll on you.”

Jolin plans to study H3 Chemistry and Biology, and then work in the pharmaceutical industry or teaching field.

**Leow Tze See (S4E1)**

Having served as a dedicated member and President of the Swiss Publications and Media Club (PMC), Tze See exemplified the value of Honour through active participation and a genuine desire to learn and excel. She was also a caring and supportive friend to her peers. In her readiness to improve her competencies by being receptive to feedback, she also displayed humility.

Tze See realized excellent results which saw her achieving a raw score of 6 points for her L1R5. With her two CCA bonus points, Tze See would enjoy many post-secondary options.

“I feel so relieved. I was originally uncertain and nervous that I may not be able to meet my expectations!”

Tze See pointed out that the factors that helped her achieve her goals were discipline and resilience. She explained that the path she took was not always easy. For example, at the end of Secondary 3, her results were far from ideal and she was afraid that she would not be able to catch up in in her graduating year.

“During my sec 4 year there were also times when I felt disappointed in myself and instances when I felt like I wanted to give up on a subject,” she shared. “There were even times when I felt burnt out.”

However, the encouraging words from the people around her kept her going and allowed her to develop the resilience to weather through the academic storms she had to face – her struggles with Additional Mathematics and Higher Chinese.

“In Sec 3, I had a lot of trouble with A Math. I could barely pass. I even wanted to give up on that subject, but my teachers, parents and friends persuaded me to continue trying. I managed to get a B3 for my A Math during the mid-year exams,” she recalled with relief.

Her effort paid off and her triumph gave her newfound motivation and hope for areas in her other subjects that she found difficult, such as Higher Chinese. It was another subject that she found herself not meeting her expectations, and she was getting Grade C from Sec 1 to 3.  In Sec 4, she felt that the difficulty of Higher Chinese seemed to have only increased. She worried that she may not pass Higher Chinese and that her four years of effort would be in vain. But knowing that the only way forward was to get down to action, she sought help.

“I would meet with my Chinese teacher Mdm Loh Yuhui regularly for consultations,” she shared. “I would also do extra writing and reading practices consistently to get the exposure to different types of questions.”

Tze See also expressed her utmost gratitude to her parents, friends and other teachers like Ms Faith and Mr Christopher Lim who supported and motivated her throughout her academic journey.

Her parting advice to her peers was, “It is never too late to turn the tables. Often time, when we think that all hope is lost, but we can make a comeback. We just have to take that first step forward and start.”

She has plans to take the Junior College route and looks forward to the next lap of her journey.

**Samuel Leong Yin Qin (4E2)**

A jubilant and disbelieving Samuel was stunned at the excellent results he scored at the GCE O levels. He scored an impressive L1R5 score of 9 and 7 distinctions – a testament to the hard work and dedication he had put in.

According to Samuel, his good results were almost unexpected, considering his history of academic struggles and lacklustre achievements. In fact, Samuel’s gifting was in sports, and he was one of our students who had enrolled in school through the Direct School Admission (DSA) route. Being an active contributor at Basketball, he rose to become the boys’ team’s Vice-Captain. By 2022, he achieved the EAGLES Award, having exhibited the school value of honour by demonstrating steady progress in sports and leadership over his four years in school.

The humble and realistic aspect of Samuel’s personality remained cognizant that when he first entered Swiss Cottage Secondary School, he was scoring grades of largely F9 and E8; and he was even one of the students at the bottom of his cohort. His dismal performance led to a meeting between his parents and the then Vice Principal, Mr. Hoi when he was in the Lower Secondary. Samuel recounted the dreadful results and the resultant soul-searching moments in the school leader’s office. The discussions helped him take stock of his aims and what he needs to do.

“From then on, I believed that I must and can really do well in my studies, if I worked hard.”

In Secondary 3, he took his academic studies more seriously and did well for his school-based assessments. In his final year, he again had to take stock of poor mid-year and preliminary examination results. But Samuel never lost faith in himself. By then, Samuel understood that academic success was not about having some lofty goal, but rather about taking the opportunity to learn and discover more. After all, there was much to consolidate and master.

A critical factor in his eventful academic journey was the support of the people around him. He recalled the faith Mr Kenneth Neo extended to him, and the valuable feedback of that teachers like Mr. Lee De Yi, Ms. Faza and Mr. Tan Hong Cheong, provided. He was also grateful to Mr Toh for not only accepting via the DSA route but also for providing the extra Math classes during his lower secondary years, along with the other DSA students who needed to catch up. In fact, he shared that both Mr Toh and Mr Sherwin Cheng were supportive of Samuel’s well-being throughout his time at Swiss Cottage, until he graduated. Last but not least, he appreciated his parents for their special blessings like treating him to good food during his GCE O-level exams.

Ready for the next lap, Samuel shared that as someone who had always been fascinated by the intricacies of the human body and its various functions, he was determined to pursue a career in the medical field; his ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on the lives of others by becoming a skilled and compassionate doctor. To prepare for his Junior College education, Samuel has chosen a rigorous course load that includes Biology, Chemistry, Economics and Mathematics. Determined to work hard and make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow, his message to others is simple: “Just do it!”

<img src="/images/Swiss%20Achievements/Swiss%20Success%20Stories/2022%20O%20Level%20Success%20Stories/Hannah-Tan-Shi-Ting.jpeg" style="width:20%;float:left"><br clear="left">

**Hannah Tan Shi Ting (4E2)**

“I actually feel surprised by my results, because my confidence dipped, after taking a number of papers, that I thought were challenging,” she shared, and then added with happiness, “However, I’m glad that my hard work and hours of studying have paid off.”

Hannah has an impressive attainment of 8 distinctions in her GCE O-level results. And she also excelled at sports. Besides being an athlete, she was the Vice-Captain of the school’s floorball team (Girls) which came in National ‘B’ Division champions. As the leader of the team, she exhibited honour in the way she conducted herself as a role model for the team, taking training seriously and pushing her peers to do their best. Now, with her stellar GCE O level results, she shows us that hard work and determination can lead to great success, setting a great example for students who wish to enjoy holistic success. Her achievements showcase a remarkable ability to balance her time and effort in both the academics and sports.

However, during Hannah’s journey to success, she did face several challenges. For example, she had struggled with self-doubt and a lack of confidence. Even so, she would not let these innate hindrances hold her back. Instead, she channeled her energy rather concretely into studying and working hard to achieve her goals. For example, she kept up a positive attitude in learning the Chinese language despite not doing well during school assessments. Her humility led to a distinction at the GCE O Levels. Moments like this when she did not do well turned into deep motivation and resolve to do better, and another such moment was the Mid-Year examinations.

“I was shocked because I had failed two subjects. It served as a wake-up call to me because I suddenly realized that I would not be able to get into the JC that I wanted,” she shared. On top of the pressure of meeting her goals, Hannah also shared the fears of not being able to live up to her own expectations. She summed it all up, saying, “I did not want to be the one left behind.”

When asked about her reasons for her feats in both areas, she attributed them to effort and determination as well as the motivation from the previous batch of seniors.

“They did especially well in their O-levels, and I aspired to reach their level as well. With the encouragement of my family members and my peers, I was able to perform to the best of my abilities and have the strength to work harder,” she said.

She expressed a deep sense of gratitude to her form teachers and CCA teachers for their endless support and guidance. “Their patience and kindness definitely helped me to have more faith in myself and in turn, I found it possible to reach out to them for help,” she said.

Hannah plans to pursue the science stream with Biology, Chemistry, and Economics in Junior College. However, she is still unsure about her aspirations and what she wants to be in the future. “I do hope I figure it out in JC. For now, I think I want to be dentist or an optometrist in the future,” she said.

**Matthew Anthony Style \[4N2\]**

“It’s the little victories that come our way that matter,” quipped Matthew – who scored an EMB3 9 with 5 distinctions.

Like many of his peers, Matthew had a bag of responsibilities. He served as Staff Sergeant in National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) and as a Safety Ambassador. As responsible student, he exhibited Honour through the dedication that he showed to his CCA and in the submission of high quality of his school work. He also exhibited Humility by displaying his willingness to learn and by being receptive to feedback.

Matthew shared that success comes from the small successes that one gains along the way. He shared how he had scored full marks for his mathematics Weighted Assessment 1 (WA1), and how it was an important milestone in the many little steps he took towards the national examinations. Matthew recalled that the incident was instrumental in giving him ‘newfound confidence’ in himself.

“I challenged myself to attempt harder questions so I could be sure I wasn’t getting ahead of myself and so that I could be prepared for anything,” he shared pragmatically.

When asked about how he had succeeded in achieving 5 distinctions and an EMB3 of 9 points, Matthew shared that he took the initiative to clarify his doubts whenever he was unsure about any topic. He did this consistently for all his subjects. This openness to clearing up uncertainties in timely ways allowed him to ensure that he had a good level of understanding of each discipline – which helped in to consolidate larger bodies of knowledge and skills as time progressed and volume of learning multiplied. 

As a reflective thinker and learner, Matthew also shared how he had assiduously read through his practice assignment pieces to see where he had made mistakes so that he will not repeat them again in the next test or examination. Hi teachers described him as a highly participative who would inject positivity during lessons to encourage peers to stay focused and learn well.

“I feel proud of my achievements because I actually felt uneasy about how I would perform after my examinations. I was happy that I had done much better than I had for my preliminary examinations,” shared a delighted Matthew.

Matthew would be keen to pursue his studies in either biomedical sciences or pharmaceutical research, which are areas of study that he has a keen passion and interest in. Matthew thanked all teachers who have made his success possible and hopes that he has made them proud.

**Muhammad Akif Taruna Bin Jafataruna \[4N1\]**

‘Ecstatic’ was the word that Akif used to describe how he felt after receiving an EMB3 of 8 points and 6 distinctions. Elated, he thanked his parents, teachers and friends for their unstinting support which contributed towards his success.

“When I received back my prelim results for all my subjects, I know I could have done better,” recollected Akif, when asked if there was a defining moment he could share. He added, “During the few months before the N level examinations, I pushed myself very hard. The goal was to perform better than the Preliminary Examinations.”

Akif recounted how holding three leadership positions during his Secondary Three year was not an easy task. He served as a member of Floorball team, Student Council and the House Executive Committee. He often found himself struggling to complete his assignments and study for his tests amidst a busy schedule.

“I knew I needed time management and a healthy mindset to manage all commitments. I needed to free up time. So during any free period that I had, I would take the time to work on subjects I was weaker in, such as Math and my Sciences. This move meant that I could delegate time for other subjects so that I could revise all my subjects fairly,” he reminisced.

Akif was described by his teachers as a highly participative individual with positive learning attitude. He was also known to be proactive in seeking help for self-improvement. In fact, he exhibited Honour when he showed perseverance and followed through plans. For example, his strategy of prioritising the study of mathematics and science which were his weaker subjects definitely paid off in the end. •He also exhibited Humility by asking useful questions to improve understanding and knowledge. He made steady progress that culminated in the happy results he received in the N levels.

Akif aspires to work in the medical field to save lives and help others in need. He shared that he has plans to either apply for the Biomedical Science course is Singapore Polytechnic or the Nursing course in Ngee Ann Polytechnic through the Poly Foundation Programme (PFP).

“To all my juniors, cherish your time in Swiss cause because you will miss it,” quipped Akif, who believes in making the most of the time one has, to fully engage on the opportunities that come in one’s way.

**Yong Haiwen John \[4N1\]**

Haiwen was a picture of joy and satisfaction as he shared how managed to obtain an EMB3 of 8 points including 4 distinctions.

He attributed his success to his consistency in revising what he had learnt in school every single day. He cited how he would stay in school till evening to revisit a concept such as covalent bonds in Chemistry so that he can reinforce his understanding of it.  He also shared that he chose to study in school as he felt that it was a conducive environment that allowed him to be highly prolific. He explained, “I was away from distractions like my computer, I could study more productively without being distracted.”

  
Haiwen shared that another key reason for his success was his desire to pursue passion in an aerospace related career. “I have a passion for airplanes. And when I saw that some polytechnics offered aerospace courses, I was excited and I set my goals to get the desired grades to land a chance of applying for the aerospace programme.’

His quest for academic excellence was not always a smooth journey, but Haiwen persevered. Like many students, Haiwen shared that one of his greatest fears was falling short of his expected grades. He recounted how he was shocked when his mid-year examination results fell short of his expectations. He could not allow fear of failure to get the better of him.  He went back to the drawing board to work on his revision methods, and he redirected his focus, working on more practice papers to give himself the confidence to do well.

Besides his self-directed attitude in the academic domain, he also contributed to the school by serving as Staff Sergeant in NCC (Air). In all areas, he exhibited Honour by doing the right thing even if it was difficult or inconvenient. He was also commended for his Humility in the way he actively self-reflected for self-improvement.

On the happy day of his results, Haiwen also had some words of thanks for his teachers: “To all my teachers, thank you all for teaching me and guiding me to achieve what I have today. Thank you!”

Haiwen was very clear about his desire to pursue his studies in aerospace engineering. He shared that he would like to be either an air force engineer or work in the aerospace department in Singapore Technology Engineering.
