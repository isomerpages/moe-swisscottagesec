Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.

General academic ability test e.g. General Ability Test (GAT) and Higher Ability Selection Test (HAST) are not required as part of school’s selection process.

\*\*Shortlisted applicants will be notified to attend school-based interview and selection trial (where applicable). The School reserves the right not to release the results and details of the shortlisting process, interview and selection trial to applicants who are not successful in the DSA.\*\*
