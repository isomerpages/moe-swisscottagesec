<p>There will be no trying on of uniforms during the purchase. All uniform
purchases will be done via measurements. Students can choose to make suitable
alterations to their uniforms on their own to ensure their school uniforms
smart and appropriate for school. However, no fanciful modifications to
the uniform should be done (e.g. there should be no tapering of pants and
skirt lengths should be at least beneath the knee.)</p>

<p>DSA students can purchase their uniform and books first from Friday, 19
December 2025 onwards.</p>
