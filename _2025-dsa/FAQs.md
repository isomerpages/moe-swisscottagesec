<p>Student Council is not considered a CCA in Swiss Cottage. You can choose
any CCA to join if you pass the selection trials for that particular CCA.
Joining the Student Council is not automatic even if you had come into
Swiss Cottage via Leadership DSA. There is a selection process for one
to become a member of Student Council.</p>

<p>Academic results is one part of the selection criteria and the school
will assess all applicants holistically. It is important for applicants
to consider carefully if they are able to balance the demand and rigour
of the academic posting group (i.e. PG1, 2 or 3) in the school they are
applying for alongside their commitment to their DSA talent area. In 2025,
the PSLE cut-off points for the respective posting groups are as follow:</p>
<p>Posting Group 3: AL 10
<br>Posting Group 2: AL 21-22
<br>Posting Group 1: AL 25-26</p>

<p>The DSA process is a commitment between the student and the school. Once
the child has been accepted by the school through a particular CCA, the
child must commit to the CCA. There are exceptions, for example the child
is injured and is not medically advisable for the child to continue with
the specific talent area. In this instance, we will have a discussion with
the child and parents.</p>
