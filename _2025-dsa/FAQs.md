<p>Academic results is one part of the selection criteria and the school
will assess all applicants holistically. It is important for applicants
to consider carefully if they are able to balance the demand and rigour
of the academic posting group (i.e. PG1, 2 or 3) in the school they are
applying for alongside their commitment to their DSA talent area. &nbsp;In
2025, the PSLE cut-off points for the respective posting groups are as
follow:</p>
<p>Posting Group 3: AL 10
<br>Posting Group 2: AL 21-22

<p>The DSA process is a commitment between the student and the school. &nbsp;Once
the child has been accepted by the school through a particular talent area,
the child must commit to the relevant CCA. &nbsp;There are exceptions,
for example the child is injured and is not medically able to continue
with the CCA. &nbsp;In this instance, we will have a discussion with the
child and parents.</p>
