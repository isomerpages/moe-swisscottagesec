<h1>Full Subject-Based Banding</h1>
<p><strong><u>Purpose of Full SBB</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many
subject bands, to better meet our studentsâ€™ learning needs, without labels.
This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise
the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence
and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.</p>
<p>For details of the Full Subject Based Banding Curriculum, please refer
