# 2022 Sec 2 Subject Combination

<p style="text-align: justify;">The subject combination exercise done at the end of Secondary 2 is an important exercise that aims to provide our students with interesting and relevant subject options of study at the upper secondary level for future academic progression and careers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As such, we have prepared a series of videos and slides to help you and your child make an informed decision. These videos will serve as a guide for the considerations and processes of this exercise. The videos will also explain the combination of subjects that will be offered.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Please view the Introductory video before proceeding to the respective videos, depending on which level of subjects (G1, G2 or G3) the student predominantly takes.</p>
