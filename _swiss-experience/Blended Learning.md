# Blended Learning

<p style="text-align: justify;">Accelerated by school closures amid COVID-19, blended learning has become the new normal. In July 2021, Swiss Cottage started Blended Learning. Blended learning combines independent learning (learning at home without direct teacher supervision) with in-school experience (learning directly facilitated by teachers and supported by peers in a face-to-face setting). In short, the blended model makes e-learning or home-based learning (HBL) part and parcel of the students’ overall school life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">By experiencing both types of learning experiences at regular intervals, the school hopes that students will pick up the relevant skills and dispositions that will make them self-directed and lifelong learners. With HBL taking place fortnightly – on even-week Fridays, students have time for curriculum work (about 4 hours’ worth), as well as the space to pursue their own interests (about 1 hour).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school has embraced the new norm or blended learning comfortably, thanks to the annual e-learning routines and prevalent use of technology in day-to-day lessons. Hence, though we did find ourselves having to catapult into the new normal in 2020, we have more than survived the change.; we have thrived and continue to appreciate the benefits of independent learning alongside the support and social interaction in a school environment.</p>
