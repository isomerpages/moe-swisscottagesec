<b><u>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) @ Swiss</u></b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the <b>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</b> for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>

The intended outcomes of PDLP@Swiss are:

1\.  <b><u>Enhance teaching and learning</u> – PLDs harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning, enabled by teachers’ use of e-Pedagogy to provide learning experiences for students.</b>
   
2\.  <b><u>Support self-directed and collaborative learning</u> – PLDs enable students to learn online according to their needs and interests and to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere.</b> 
	 
3\.  <b><u>Support the Development of Digital Literacies through the PACKAGE FRAMEWORK</u> – PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment. The PACKAGE Framework (see below) guides the school in:</b>
    
a.  **Designing tiered skill development of students;**  
b.  **Designing learning experiences that are focused on enabling students to participate in both Synchronous and Asynchronous learning;**

<b><u>Personal Learning Device (PLD)</u></b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Swiss Students will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple Pencil and casing with smart keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only is the iPad a portable device that offers students the convenience of learning on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. In addition to apps within Apple’s eco-system, students will also gain access toa wide range of software from other developers (e.g. Google Suite and Microsoft Office etc), making it the device of choice in developing students’ application and creative skills.</p>

For Swiss Cottage, each PLD bundle consists of:  
1\) Apple iPad 10.2″ 9th Generation (2021) 64 GB Wifi  
2\) Logitech Rugged Combo 3 (smart keyboard with casing)  
3\) Apple Pencil 1
