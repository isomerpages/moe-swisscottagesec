<b><u>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) @ Swiss</u></b>

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the **National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)** for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.

The intended outcomes of PDLP@Swiss are:

1.  #### **Enhance teaching and learning** **–** PLDs harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning, enabled by teachers’ use of **e-Pedagogy** to provide learning experiences for students.
    
2.  #### **Support self-directed and collaborative learning –** PLDs enable students to learn online according to their needs and interests and to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere.
    
3.  #### **Support the Development of Digital Literacies through the PACKAGE FRAMEWORK–** PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment. The PACKAGE Framework (see below) guides the school in:
    
    1.  #### Designing tiered skill development of students;
        
    2.  #### Designing learning experiences that are focused on enabling students to participate in both Synchronous and Asynchronous learning;
