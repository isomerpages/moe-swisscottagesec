# Code of Conduct and School Rules

<b>Swiss Cottage takes a <u>Character First</u> approach in developing our students. The school wishes to instil positive values in the students so that they can self-regulate, while at the same time affirm the good in every student through various platforms.</b>

### <b><u>SWISS R.U.L.E.S.</u></b>

As a Swiss student, I will uphold Swiss R.U.L.E.S.:

**Respect & Responsibility**

*   Respect myself and all those working in the school.
*   Respect the right of my fellow schoolmates to learn and the right of teachers to teach.
*   Respect our school property and the property of others.
*   Be responsible for all that we do and say.

**Uniform and Appearance**

*   Wear my uniform as prescribed by the school and not modify the uniform.
*   Wear appropriate attire for all functions and events.
*   Wear appropriate attire for special classes (e.g., Physical Education and Food & Consumer Education).
*   Keep a neat and tidy hairstyle.

**Learning**

*   Work to the best of my ability in our academic endeavours and co-curricular activities.
*   Attend all classes with the appropriate learning materials and be prepared for my lessons.
*   Be responsible in completing all homework on time and attempt to the best of my ability.
*   Follow classroom and school rules.
*   Be _Ready to Learn_, which means that in between lessons, I will help to tidy my classroom, take out relevant learning materials and get mentally prepared for the next lesson.

**Environment**

*   Take good care of my classroom, school grounds and property.
*   Conserve electricity when possible, such as by switching off fans and lights when not in use.
*   Work together to create a harmonious, friendly and safe learning environment for all.
*   Not eat or drink outside the canteen area and during lesson time.
*   Not litter all the time.
*   Be considerate to my schoolmates who are still having lessons.

**Safety & Security**

*   Act in a safe and responsible manner in school.
*   Act in a safe manner while travelling to and from school and during excursions.
*   Resolve differences and conflicts by negotiations.
*   Keep my school free from tobacco-related products, non-prescribed drugs, undesirable print and non-print materials, weapons and weapon-like objects.
*   Keep my school safe from external dangers.
