# Code of Conduct and School Rules

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Swiss Cottage takes a&nbsp;Character First approach&nbsp;in developing our students. The school wishes to instil positive values in the students so that they can self-regulate, while at the same time affirm the good in every student through various platforms.</b></p>

*   Keep my school safe from external dangers.

### <b><u>SWISS CODE OF CONDUCT</u></b>

**The Swiss Code of Conduct is guided by two principles:**

**(1) School Pride and (2) Self-Discipline**

|                                                |                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Swiss Cottage strives to build strong school pride in our students.** | **School prid**e is a love for the school, the feeling that we belong to Swiss Cottage – a special school. The Swiss values of Honour and Humility, govern the way we Think, Care and Lead.<br><br>Students with a deep sense of pride in the school will conduct themselves with respect and responsibility towards the school, the staff and fellow Swiss students. Swiss students should strive to maintain full attendance, a smart appearance, a positive attitude, high aspirations and hence attain satisfying achievements. |
| **Swiss Cottage strives to help students be self-disciplined.**         | A self-disciplined person is a master of himself who knows how to act with respect and responsibility. A self-disciplined person has the strength of mind to speak and act in ways that are appropriate, and to avoid speech and conduct that are inappropriate.<br><br>A self-disciplined person has the strength of character to persevere in spite of stress or setbacks, to press on to balance academics, CCAs, other school activities and core commitments to family/friends.                                                                                             |

6\.  **General Appearance**

**Spectacles**

*   Wear simple single-coloured spectacle frames.
*   Do not wear multi-coloured and fanciful spectacle frames.
*   Do not wear tinted glasses and coloured contact lenses in school.

**Jewellery**

*   Only girls are allowed to wear one simple pair of ear-stud (not more than ~ 0.5 cm in diameter) on each ear lobe.

*   Do not wear any headgear.
*   Wear only plain black, white or dark-coloured sweaters, windbreakers or cardigans in class.
*   Do not wear any make-up.
*   Do not have any tattoos on your body.

7\.  **Attendance**

*   Inform your Form Teacher when you are unable to attend school due to illness or urgent family matters by&nbsp;**0715 hrs**. You could also inform your class chairman to help relay the information to your form teacher.
*   **Students should report to the assembly ground before 0730 hrs (0800 hrs on Thursdays). If you are not in the assembly ground by 0730 hrs (0800 hrs on Thursdays), you will be considered late for school.**
*   The school takes a serious view on late-coming and students who are late for morning assembly will face consequences.
*   Submit a medical certificate (MC) to the form teacher on the day you return to the school. The school accepts letters from parents/guardians only on a case-by-case basis (a maximum of 2 letters per term).
*   Students who do not submit MCs or the necessary documents will be marked as ‘Absent without valid reason’. The school will thus treat this as a case of truancy, if students are unable to explain their absence.
*   Seek the approval of your form teacher if you need to leave the school premises before the end of the last lesson. You will need to sign in the ‘Permission to Leave Early’ slip in the General Office before you leave.
*   Your parent or guardian needs to accompany you home if you leave school early.

8\.  **Movement during Curriculum Time**

*   Seek your teachers’ permission before leaving the classroom.
*   Move quietly when moving to the next venue during curriculum time.
*   Do not loiter along corridors at any time, including the breaks.

9\.  **Others**

*   You are not allowed to have in possession any weapon. You are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which is used or intended to be used to cause harm to others.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The school would like to develop in all students self-discipline.<br>The observance of school rules is one of the key pillars to achieve a fruitful school experience.</b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hence, to help students learn from and correct negative conduct when they misbehave or break school rules, appropriate consequences will be meted out to the students concerned.</b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The school wishes all students a successful learning experience.</b></p>

### <b><u>MOBILE PHONE POLICY</u></b>

<u>Rationale</u>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We recognise that many students own a mobile phone, and that some parents/guardians request that their child/ward to bring a mobile phone to school for safety and accountability purposes.&nbsp; To ensure a conducive environment for our students, unnecessary distractions or disruptions should be avoided. Therefore, the school strongly discourages students from bringing mobile phones to school. However, if there is a need, students are allowed to use their mobile phones outside curriculum time (including CCA time) in the canteen or at the foyer unless authorised by a teacher.</p>

<u>Responsibility of Student</u>

*   All mobile phones must be switched off during curriculum hours.

*   Students are responsible for their mobile phones.
*   Mobile phones brought to school are entirely at students’ own risk.
*   The school accepts no responsibility for replacing lost, stolen or damaged mobile phones.

<u>Consequence</u>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the responsibility of students who bring mobile phones to school to abide by the rules outlined by the school. The decision to provide a mobile phone to their child should be made by parents/guardians. It is the duty of the parents to understand the potential use and/or misuse of mobile phones.</p>

Mobile phones will be confiscated for 3 working days if students do not adhere to the rules.

Confiscated phones will be switched off and kept in a safe at the General Office.

In cases of emergency, the general office contact number remains a vital and appropriate point of contact.

### <b><u>CONDUCT GRADING AND DEMERIT POINT SYSTEM</u></b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school recognises students who consistently display an excellent conduct and exhibit Honour and Humility throughout the semester. Acts of integrity and self-responsibility are also affirmed and acknowledged by the school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school uses a demerit point system to help monitor and assign the Conduct Grades for students. Students who do not uphold any of the rules may be given demerit points, in addition to other appropriate consequences meted out by the Student Discipline Committee.</p>

**CONDUCT GRADING**

<p style="text-align: justify;">A student’s Conduct Grade, as reflected in the Report Card, is related to the student’s conduct and behaviour throughout the year. The Conduct Grading takes into account the student’s attitude in his or her daily work such as whether there is respect for teachers and whether self-responsibility is exhibited by the student. The student’s attendance, punctuality in school and the number of demerit points accumulated are also important criteria in determining the student’s Conduct Grade.</p>

|           |                    |
|-----------|---------|
| **Excellent** | A student who is excellent in conduct consistently displays positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she shows&nbsp;**HONOUR**&nbsp;by&nbsp;**making decisions with integrity**,&nbsp;**treating others with respect**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**creating a culture of honour**&nbsp;<u>consistently</u>.<br><br>He or she also shows&nbsp;**HUMILITY**&nbsp;by&nbsp;**seeking personal improvement**,&nbsp;**taking into account the needs and challenges of others**&nbsp;while&nbsp;**embracing the world with open-mindedness**&nbsp;<u>consistently</u>.                   |

| **Good**      | A student who is good in conduct displays <u>some</u> positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she shows some HONOUR by making decisions with integrity, treating others with respect and creating a culture of honour <u>sometimes</u>.<br><br>He or she also shows HUMILITY <u>generally</u> by seeking personal improvement, taking into account the needs and challenges of others while embracing the world with open-mindedness <u>sometimes</u>.                        |
| **Fair**      | A student who is fair in conduct is&nbsp;<u>developing</u>&nbsp;positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she is&nbsp;<u>developing</u>&nbsp;**HONOUR**&nbsp;by&nbsp;<u>attempting</u>&nbsp;to&nbsp;**make decisions with integrity**,&nbsp;**treat others with respect**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**create a culture of honour**. <br><br>He or she also is&nbsp;<u>developing</u>&nbsp;**HUMILITY**&nbsp;by&nbsp;<u>attempting</u>&nbsp;to&nbsp;**seek personal improvement**,&nbsp;**take into account the needs and challenges of others**&nbsp;while&nbsp;**embrace the world with open-mindedness**.                             |
| **Poor**      | A student who is poor in conduct needs to display more positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she&nbsp;<u>needs to show more</u>&nbsp;**HONOUR**&nbsp;by&nbsp;**making decisions with integrity**,&nbsp;**treating others with respect**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**creating a culture of honour**.<br><br>He or she also&nbsp;<u>needs to show more</u>&nbsp;**HUMILITY**&nbsp;by&nbsp;**seeking personal improvement**,&nbsp;**taking into account the needs and challenges of others**&nbsp;while&nbsp;**embracing the world with open-mindedness**.                         |

Students who received a&nbsp;<u>FAIR/POOR</u>&nbsp;conduct grade will face the following consequences:

*   They will be barred from representing Swiss in any inter-school/international competitions for the following semester.
*   They will be barred from any overseas trips or any other activities at the discretion of the school for the following semester.
*   They will be required to attend a Conduct Upgrading programme, ranging from 1 to 5 days at the end of the semester so as to reset the Demerit points to ZERO for the following semester. Students who do not attend the Conduct Upgrading programme will have their demerit points accrued for the next semester.
*   Lastly, students who received a FAIR/POOR Conduct Grade at the end of the year do not qualify for any monetary awards from MOE.&nbsp;

**DEMERIT POINT SYSTEM**

<p style="text-align: justify;">This table spells out the possible consequences of accumulating the number of demerit points for offences committed in the course of the semester.</p>
