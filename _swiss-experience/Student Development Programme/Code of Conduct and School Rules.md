# Code of Conduct and School Rules

<b>Swiss Cottage takes a <u>Character First</u> approach in developing our students. The school wishes to instil positive values in the students so that they can self-regulate, while at the same time affirm the good in every student through various platforms.</b>

### <b><u>SWISS R.U.L.E.S.</u></b>

As a Swiss student, I will uphold Swiss R.U.L.E.S.:

**Respect & Responsibility**

*   Respect myself and all those working in the school.
*   Respect the right of my fellow schoolmates to learn and the right of teachers to teach.
*   Respect our school property and the property of others.
*   Be responsible for all that we do and say.

**Uniform and Appearance**

*   Wear my uniform as prescribed by the school and not modify the uniform.
*   Wear appropriate attire for all functions and events.
*   Wear appropriate attire for special classes (e.g., Physical Education and Food & Consumer Education).
*   Keep a neat and tidy hairstyle.

**Learning**

*   Work to the best of my ability in our academic endeavours and co-curricular activities.
*   Attend all classes with the appropriate learning materials and be prepared for my lessons.
*   Be responsible in completing all homework on time and attempt to the best of my ability.
*   Follow classroom and school rules.
*   Be _Ready to Learn_, which means that in between lessons, I will help to tidy my classroom, take out relevant learning materials and get mentally prepared for the next lesson.

**Environment**

*   Take good care of my classroom, school grounds and property.
*   Conserve electricity when possible, such as by switching off fans and lights when not in use.
*   Work together to create a harmonious, friendly and safe learning environment for all.
*   Not eat or drink outside the canteen area and during lesson time.
*   Not litter all the time.
*   Be considerate to my schoolmates who are still having lessons.

**Safety & Security**

*   Act in a safe and responsible manner in school.
*   Act in a safe manner while travelling to and from school and during excursions.
*   Resolve differences and conflicts by negotiations.
*   Keep my school free from tobacco-related products, non-prescribed drugs, undesirable print and non-print materials, weapons and weapon-like objects.
*   Keep my school safe from external dangers.

### <b><u>SWISS CODE OF CONDUCT</u></b>

**The Swiss Code of Conduct is guided by two principles:**

**(1) School Pride and (2) Self-Discipline**

|                                                |                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Swiss Cottage strives to build strong school pride in our students.** | **School prid**e is a love for the school, the feeling that we belong to Swiss Cottage – a special school. The Swiss values of **P**assion, **R**esilience, **I**ntegrity, **D**are to Try and **E**mpathy (P.R.I.D.E.), govern the way we Think, Care and Lead.<br><br>Students with a deep sense of pride in the school will conduct themselves with respect and responsibility towards the school, the staff and fellow Swiss students. Swiss students should strive to maintain full attendance, a smart appearance, a positive attitude, high aspirations and hence attain satisfying achievements. |
| **Swiss Cottage strives to help students be self-disciplined.**         | A self-disciplined person is a master of himself who knows how to act with respect and responsibility. A self-disciplined person has the strength of mind to speak and act in ways that are appropriate, and to avoid speech and conduct that are inappropriate.<br><br>A self-disciplined person has the strength of character to persevere in spite of stress or setbacks, to press on to balance academics, CCAs, other school activities and core commitments to family/friends.                                                                                             |
