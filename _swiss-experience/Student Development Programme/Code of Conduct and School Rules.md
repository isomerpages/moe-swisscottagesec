The school will thus treat this as a case of truancy, if students are unable to explain their absence.</p></li><li><p>Seek the approval of your form teacher if you need to leave the school premises before the end of the last lesson. You will need to sign in the ‘Permission to Leave Early’ slip in the General Office before you leave.</p></li><li><p>Your parent or guardian needs to accompany you home if you leave school early.</p></li></ul><p>8. <strong>Movement during Curriculum Time</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Seek your teachers’ permission before leaving the classroom.</p></li><li><p>Move quietly when moving to the next venue during curriculum time.</p></li><li><p>Do not loiter along corridors at any time, including the breaks.</p></li></ul><p>9. <strong>Others</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>You are not allowed to have in possession any weapon.

Hence the school encourages responsible usage of mobile phones.</p><p><u>Rules and Responsibilitities of Student</u></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All mobile phones must be switched to silent mode during curriculum hours.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile phones can be used anywhere before the official reporting time.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile phones can only be used in the library, canteen or at the foyer after curriculum hours (Recess, lunch breaks and after last timetabled lesson).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are responsible for their mobile phones and strongly encouraged to lock their mobile phones in their individual lockers during curriculum hours.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile phones are used for educational and communication purposes.</p><p>Gaming is not allowed.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile phones brought to school are entirely at students’ own risk.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school accepts no responsibility for replacing lost, stolen or damaged mobile phones.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should not be capturing and uploading any materials on social media with their mobile phones when they are in school.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile Phones can be confiscated for up to 3 working days if students do not adhere to the rules.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if there is a need for students&nbsp; to&nbsp; use&nbsp; their&nbsp; mobile&nbsp; phones&nbsp; outside&nbsp; of the stipulated guidelines, it may be allowed on a case-by-case basis by the school authorities.</p><p><u>Consequence</u></p><p>It is the responsibility of students who bring mobile phones to school to abide by the rules outlined by the school. The decision to provide a mobile phone to their child should be made by parents/guardians. It is the duty of the parents to understand the potential use and/or misuse of mobile phones.</p><p>Mobile phones will be confiscated for 3 working days if students do not adhere to the rules.</p><p>Confiscated phones will be switched off and kept in a safe at the General Office.</p><p>In cases of emergency, the general office contact number remains a vital and appropriate point of contact.</p><h3><strong><u>CONDUCT GRADING AND DEMERIT POINT SYSTEM</u></strong></h3><p>The school recognises students who consistently display an excellent conduct and exhibit Honour and Humility throughout the semester. Acts of integrity and self-responsibility are also affirmed and acknowledged by the school.</p><p>The school uses a demerit point system to help monitor and assign the Conduct Grades for students. Students who do not uphold any of the rules may be given demerit points, in addition to other appropriate consequences meted out by the Student Discipline Committee.</p><p><strong>CONDUCT GRADING</strong></p><p>A student’s Conduct Grade, as reflected in the Report Card, is related to the student’s conduct and behaviour throughout the year. The Conduct Grading takes into account the student’s attitude in his or her daily work such as whether there is respect for teachers and whether self-responsibility is exhibited by the student. The student’s attendance, punctuality in school and the number of demerit points accumulated are also important criteria in determining the student’s Conduct Grade.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Excellent</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>A student who is excellent in conduct consistently displays positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she shows&nbsp;<strong>HONOUR</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>making decisions with integrity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>treating others with respect</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>creating a culture of honour</strong>&nbsp;<u>consistently</u>.<br><br>He or she also shows&nbsp;<strong>HUMILITY</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>seeking personal improvement</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>taking into account the needs and challenges of others</strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>embracing the world with open-mindedness</strong>&nbsp;<u>consistently</u>.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Very Good</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>A student who is very good in conduct largely displays positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she shows&nbsp;<strong>HONOUR</strong>&nbsp;<u>largely</u>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>making decisions with integrity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>treating others with respect</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>creating a culture of honour</strong>&nbsp;<u>most of the time</u>.<br><br>He or she also shows&nbsp;<strong>HUMILITY</strong>&nbsp;<u>largely</u>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>seeking personal improvement</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>taking into account the needs and challenges of others</strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>embracing the world with open-mindedness</strong> <u>most of the time.</u></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Good</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>A student who is good in conduct displays <u>some</u> positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she shows some HONOUR by making decisions with integrity, treating others with respect and creating a culture of honour <u>sometimes</u>.<br><br>He or she also shows HUMILITY <u>generally</u> by seeking personal improvement, taking into account the needs and challenges of others while embracing the world with open-mindedness <u>sometimes</u>.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Fair</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>A student who is fair in conduct is&nbsp;<u>developing</u>&nbsp;positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she is&nbsp;<u>developing</u>&nbsp;<strong>HONOUR</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<u>attempting</u>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>make decisions with integrity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>treat others with respect</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>create a culture of honour</strong>. <br><br>He or she also is&nbsp;<u>developing</u>&nbsp;<strong>HUMILITY</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<u>attempting</u>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>seek personal improvement</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>take into account the needs and challenges of others</strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>embrace the world with open-mindedness</strong>.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Poor</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>A student who is poor in conduct needs to display more positive dispositions in character, learning and leadership.<br><br>He or she&nbsp;<u>needs to show more</u>&nbsp;<strong>HONOUR</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>making decisions with integrity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>treating others with respect</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>creating a culture of honour</strong>.<br><br>He or she also&nbsp;<u>needs to show more</u>&nbsp;<strong>HUMILITY</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>seeking personal improvement</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>taking into account the needs and challenges of others</strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>embracing the world with open-mindedness</strong>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Students who received a&nbsp;<u>FAIR/POOR</u>&nbsp;conduct grade will face the following consequences:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>They will be barred from representing Swiss in any inter-school/international competitions for the following semester.</p></li><li><p>They will be barred from any overseas trips or any other activities at the discretion of the school for the following semester.</p></li><li><p>They will be required to attend a Conduct Upgrading programme, ranging from 1 to 5 days at the end of the semester so as to reset the Demerit points to ZERO for the following semester.
