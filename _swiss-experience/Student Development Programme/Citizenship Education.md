<h1>Citizenship Education</h1>
<p><strong>Goals of Citizenship Education</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Foster a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans;
<br>2. Teach the Singapore story — how Singapore succeeded against the odds
to become a nation;
<br>3. To help students understand Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints
and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries;
<br>4. To instill the core values of our way of life, and the will to prevail,
that ensures our continued success and well-being.</p>
<p>The platforms with which we achieve our goals are:</p>
<p>1. CCE lessons
<br>2. Infusion of NE Messages through the curriculum
<br>3. Commemoration of the National Events
<br>4. Learning journeys
<br>5. Special morning assembly presentation
<br>6. Training of Citizenship Ambassadors</p>
