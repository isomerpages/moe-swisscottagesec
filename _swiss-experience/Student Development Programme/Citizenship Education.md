**Goals of Citizenship Education**

1\.  Foster a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans;  
2\.  Teach the Singapore story — how Singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation;  
3\.  To help students understand Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries;  
4\.  To instill the core values of our way of life, and the will to prevail, that ensures our continued success and well-being.  

The platforms with which we achieve our goals are:

1\.  CCE lessons  
2\.  Infusion of NE Messages through the curriculum  
3\.  Commemoration of the National Events  
4\.  Learning journeys  
5\.  Special morning assembly presentation  
6\.  Training of Citizenship Ambassadors
