# Student Recognition

<p style="text-align: justify;">Character First is what Swiss Cottage wants to develop students in. Student Recognition Committee serves to see the “good” in every student and publicly recognise them through the various school’s platforms. This committee serves to ‘catch’ Swiss Students doing good and at the same time educate others through sharing the good habits of these role models. The guidelines for students to achieve the awards will be in accordance to the PRIDE values of the school.</p>

### Internal Student Recognition

<p style="text-align: justify;">Internal Student Recognition recognises students with good behaviour or had shown resilience to improve in their behaviour at the school level. Publicity of the good behaviour was done through presentations of the Exemplary Character Awards in the morning assemblies.&nbsp; Excellent Conduct Grade ceremonies were carried out once per semester to commend students who achieve “Excellent” conduct grade. In this way, Swiss Cottage exhibits a positive school culture with students consistently being celebrated for behaving well or doing good. Students with exemplary character were further nominated for National Awards by the External Student Recognition.</p>

**Good Stories – Helping someone in need**

“We help because it’s an instinct.” <img src="/images/Swiss%20Experience/4E4_Vicki-Article_260820.jpg" style="width:40%;float:right; padding: 10px">

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Chua Jia Xing, Joshua Shammah Daniel and Umeed Bedi (4E4’2020) saw an elderly man collapse, without a second thought, they ran over to his side. As they look at the man gradually slip out of consciousness, Jia Xing immediately called an ambulance while Umeed attended to him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“I tried to talk to him and help him to lie flat on his back. I wiped the blood off his face. I didn’t know if that’s the correct thing to do, but I just wanted to make him feel more comfortable,” said Umeed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Two girls, Yang Jieyu and Feng Siyun (3E4’2020), saw what happened so they stopped to offer tissue. Together with other passers-by, they supported the elderly man and elevated his head to slow down the bleeding from his head. Umeed offered his bag to cushion the man’s head.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The truth is, none of them had first-aid experience. “We really didn’t know what to do. But whatever little help we gave was better than none,” Joshua commented.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While Umeed stayed with the elderly man, Joshua and Jiaxing anxiously waited by the side of the road for the ambulance to lead them to the man.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the paramedics arrived, the students made way for them and took the initiative to ask passers-by to step aside. They wanted to clear the path so that the paramedics could do their job. When the crowd dispersed, the students stayed on to clean up, picking up the blood-stained tissues and the used mask that was left behind.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think what we did helped the situation in huge ways,” said Jiaxing. “How different would things be if we didn’t?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Umeed agreed. “It’s normal to feel afraid, especially when you see blood. You might even fear being judged if you step into the situation. But you can’t let your own feelings get in the way.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Yes, just do what is right. At the very least, you can say that you’ve tried.” Said Joshua.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We thank a member of the public, for writing to us, shedding light on the public-spiritedness and care that our Swiss Cottage students exemplified.</p>
