# Student Recognition

         

Character First education is the school’s core belief. The Student Discipline and Recognition Committee aims to see the good in every student and publicly recognises them through the various school platforms. We ‘catch’ Swiss Students doing good and at the same time educate others by sharing the good habits of these role models. The guidelines for students to achieve awards will be in accordance with the school values of Honour and Humility.

### Internal Student Recognition

We recognise students with good behaviour or those who have shown resilience in improving in their behaviour at the school level. The good behavior is showcased through presentations of the Exemplary Character Awards during the morning assembly.

Students can nominate their peers through the Internal Recognition Board.

Excellent Conduct Grade ceremonies are carried out once per semester to commend students who achieve Excellent Conduct Grade. Through this, Swiss Cottage aims to promote a positive school culture with students consistently celebrated for behaving well or doing good. Students with exemplary character will be further nominated for National Awards.

### External Student Recognition

We also nominate deserving students with exemplary character, excellence in their academic areas and co-curricular activities for scholarships and national awards.

The scholarship that the students can apply includes:

\-        The PRYME scholarships

\-        Leng Kwang – Swiss Cottage Scholarships
