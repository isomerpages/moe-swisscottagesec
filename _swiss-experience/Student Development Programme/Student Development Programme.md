Student Development Programme
=============================

The aim of the Student Development Programme is the holistic development of our students. Student development permeates all facets of school-life and is an integral part of the planning process in many of our programmes.

Our long-term character development framework marks out our plans to develop our students in personal responsibility, social responsibility and leadership development.

*   Code of Conduct and School Rules[
