# After School Engagement

<p style="text-align: justify;">The After School Engagement (ASE) Programme aims to build progressive levels of self-leadership development and social skills for our students in order to achieve the Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school runs the programme at D’Hangout, a centre which we have built in 2014 to allow students chill and hangout with friends after school on non-CCA days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Centre crews, with the guidance of the teachers and youth worker, will learn planning and facilitation of the Centre programmes for the school’s population. Currently, we have a crew strength of about 20 who help to run the centre, with the teachers and Youth Workers. The programme we have organised include Pool Competition, Foosball Competition and Graffiti Workshops.</p>
