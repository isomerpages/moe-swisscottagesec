# Enhanced Citizenship Education

**Enhanced Citizenship Education**

At the end of 2013, the school was looking to develop ALP (Applied Learning Programme) in the school. This coincides with the introduction of the new Humanities syllabi in 2014. This rooted the desire of the Humanities department to look into a complementary programme that would run alongside the Humanities curriculum designated by MOE which now sees inquiries as an important assessment component of the Humanities curriculum.

The department viewed that the formal Humanities education can be enriched further with Humanities values such as preservation of culture emphasized for our students especially with the onslaught of Globalization. Through this programme, students will realize that the learning of values is not compartmentalized to just Character and Citizenship Education lessons but can also be imbued in Academic subjects such as the Humanities.

The study of Conservation as the essence of this complementary Humanities learning programme also complements the school’s Citizenship Education committee’s objectives of moulding our students to be rooted Singaporeans while being active global citizens.
