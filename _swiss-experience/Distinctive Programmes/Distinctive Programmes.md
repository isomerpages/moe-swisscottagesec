**Distinctive Programmes**

Thoughtful Leaders: the vision of giving every student a chance to lead â€“ to bring about meaningful and sustainable change in their environment set new and inspiring directions for us. Our new vision, existing strengths and shifts in the national education landscape led to the development the following distinctive programmes.

The distinctive programmes are constructed on the overarching framework of Awareness, Action and Advocacy to encourage students to be Thoughtful Leaders who advocate meaningful and sustainable change to benefit others.
