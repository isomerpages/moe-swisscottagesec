**Distinctive Programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thoughtful Leaders: the vision of giving every student a chance to lead – to bring about meaningful and sustainable change in their environment set new and inspiring directions for us. Our new vision, existing strengths and shifts in the national education landscape led to the development the following distinctive programmes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The distinctive programmes are constructed on the overarching framework of Awareness, Action and Advocacy to encourage students to be Thoughtful Leaders who advocate meaningful and sustainable change to benefit others.</p>

**1\. Learning for Life: Thoughtful Leadership Programme**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We became one of the six Community Youth Leadership (CYL) schools in Singapore in 2014. To effect the CYL function well, we developed the distinctive Thoughtful Leadership Programme (TLP). The TLP is also the Learning for Life (LLP) curriculum that propels the Thoughtful Leadership focus. It is one of the two Distinctive Programmes (the second being the Applied Sciences for Sustainable Development Programme) of the school.</p>

**2\. Applied Learning Programme: Applied Sciences For Sustainable Development Programme**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Applied Sciences programme was developed and launched in 2014 with the aim of educating our youth about sustainable development. The programme provides a platform for students to develop knowledge and confidence about their potential roles in helping to ensure our future.</p>

**3\. Enhanced Citizenship Programme**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Started in 2014, the Enhanced Citizenship Programme complements the school’s Humanities Programme and enlivens the outcomes of Character and Citizenship Education by tapping on multiple platforms. The study of Conservation that the programme puts a sharp focus on helps students to navigate the balance between rootedness and openness in an age of globalization and modernity.</p>
