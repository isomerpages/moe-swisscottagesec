1.  **The Glocal Perspectives Programme**

The Glocal Perspectives Programme (GPP) aims at nurturing students’ discernment with a broad understanding of glocal (global and local) perspectives.  They will in turn be able to form their own informed personal perspectives on issues that concern them or they are concerned about. Swiss students are developed into ethical and glocal thinkers who adopt a forward looking and positive attitude. These thinking dispositions nurture Thoughtful Leadership. To achieve these outcomes, the GPP leverages pedagogical approaches such as role-play, debates and simulated forum discussions and group work, to explore contemporary issues. The discussions help students appreciate their ties to the world around them where they can make a difference.

At the end of the two years, we expect our students to be able to:

*   discuss local and world issues with confidence
*   articulate a well-considered position on an issue
*   actively initiate suggestions for possible social action and change and
*   experience knowledge amalgamation using authentic materials and contexts through the use of communication and collaboration skills as well as through independent learning and knowledge application.

2.  **Values in Action (VIA)**

The Swiss Values in Action Programme (VIAP) is a key platform to develop student character, leadership and spirit for volunteerism. The VIAP adopts a three-tiered structure ꟷ a theme-based cohort programme, school-initiated and student-directed VIA projects and lastly, Student-Initiated Projects (SIP).

Through the cohort programmes, students gain initial exposure to the needs of the society while contributing to make a positive impact in these areas. Our school-initiated activities offer a platform for students to take ownership in terms of planning and execution. They are thereafter encouraged to progress on to more self-directedness by championing their chosen areas of advocacy through Class and CCA VIA as well as SIP. For example, the Swiss Student Council initiated the Diff-Ability Project through which they offered authentic learning experiences to their peers in order to get them to better-understand the challenges of the disabled community.

3.  **Student Leadership**

The Swiss Student Leadership Programme (SLP) is based on a ‘Character First’ educational principle where good leadership stems from good character; it is about the leader’s impact and influence, not his or her position. The SLP has a two-tiered structure comprising a cohort programme and customised programmes for selected student leaders. For the cohort programme, the school delivers a student leadership curriculum that develops dispositions for Self-Leadership, Collaborative Leadership and Purpose-driven Leadership.  For selected student leaders, the customised programmes include mentoring by teacher mentors and pinnacle leadership training programmes such as leadership training camps and external leadership opportunities.

The Swiss Thoughtful Leadership Programme (TLP) is the school Learning for Life Programme (LLP). It consists of three sub-programmes, namely, (i) Glocal Perspectives Programme, (ii) Values-In-Action Programme and (iii) Student Leadership Programme. The TLP drives the development of Thoughtful Leadership qualities in students where the taught curriculum across the three sub-programmes (Awareness) culminates in the VIA efforts (Action) of the students. The VIA projects serve as platforms for students to exercise their leadership qualities to plan and offer care to the beneficiaries. Through the process, students are developed in both competencies and a spirit of youth volunteerism (Advocacy).
