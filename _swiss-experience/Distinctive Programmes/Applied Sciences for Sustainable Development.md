**SWISS APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME<br>APPLIED SCIENCES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME**

**THE CONCEPT: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT**

The [United Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) [World Commission on Environment and Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Commission_on_Environment_and_Development) released the report ‘[Our Common Future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future)’ in 1987. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions: “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Sustainable development is a discipline that combines many fields in order to solve problems faced by mankind. It takes into account economic, environmental and social factors (3 pillars) in coming out with a solution.
