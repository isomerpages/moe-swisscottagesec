# Applied Sciences for Sustainable Development

**SWISS APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME<br>APPLIED SCIENCES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME**

**THE CONCEPT: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT**

The [United Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) [World Commission on Environment and Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Commission_on_Environment_and_Development) released the report ‘[Our Common Future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future)’ in 1987. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions: “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Sustainable development is a discipline that combines many fields in order to solve problems faced by mankind. It takes into account economic, environmental and social factors (3 pillars) in coming out with a solution.

Our Swiss Applied Learning Programme (ALP) will specifically look at how applied sciences support innovations for sustainable development.

**BELIEF**

Educating our youths about sustainable development and how they contribute to its achievement helps ensure our future.

**APPROACH**

The Swiss ALP provides students with opportunities to be exposed to different areas of Sciences. It will integrate classroom learning with real-life applications and encourage students to explore how innovations in science and technology can contribute to sustainable development for mankind.

The design of the programme adopts the 3A (Awareness, Action, Advocacy) approach where each stage provides students with increasing depth of thinking and understanding. Students will first learn about sustainable developments through lesson and activities and apply it through the enrichment and specialisation programmes. Students who have been through the programme will eventually be advocates for sustainable development in the later stages. An illustration of the 3A approach is shown below.

**THE PROGRAMME**

The Swiss ALP consists of the following key programmes/projects at each level:

| Levels      | Key Programme/Project                 |
|-------------|-----------|
| Secondary 1 | • **Infusion of Applied Science themes**<br>Science lesson has been reframed under two modules. Module 1: Material Science & Module 2: Environmental Science.<br>• **Basic Science Research Programme**<br>Students learn basic research skills, use of data loggers and sensors to learn more about green buildings. Students will then feature these green building features in their final performance task.<br>• **Science Talent Development Programme (Tier 1)**<br>Selected students will be invited onto the programme. They will have opportunities to take part in enrichments and learning journeys in tertiary institutions.                                         |
| Secondary 2 | • **Infusion of Applied Science themes**<br>Science lesson has been reframed under two modules. Module 3: Mechanical & Electrical Engineering & Module 4: Biomedical Science.<br>• **Specialised Technology Programme**<br>Students will be either doing programme using Arduino or Micro:bit for their Secondary 2 enrichment. They will make use of the skills they learn to conceptualise a design spread awareness for Sustainable Development or invent an innovative and creative product. Selected groups will proceed to produce a prototype for showcase.<br>• **Science Talent Development Programme (Tier 2)**<br>Selected students on the programme will not only have the opportunity to take part in science competitions under the guidance of our teacher mentor, they may also have the chance to be attached to tertiary institutes and industrial partners. |
| Secondary 3 | • **Science Talent Development Programme (Tier 2)**<br>Selected students on the programme will not only have the opportunity to take part in Science competitions under the guidance of our teacher mentor, they may also have the chance to be attached to tertiary institutes and industrial partners.                                                                                                               |
