# Co-Curricular Activities
**Aim**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim of CCA is to build character, team spirit and responsibility through a variety of experiences and the Co-curricular activities (CCA) provide authentic platforms for students to develop skills, acquire knowledge, and practise the values and soft skills taught in schools. A meaningful CCA experience contributes to the quality of school experience for students. Through the experiences provided by CCA, students discover for themselves their interests and strengths, which we hope will translate into their lifelong pursuits. CCA also foster social integration and develop in students a sense of belonging and camaraderie. Students with enriching CCA experiences will emerge from schools strong in character, grounded in sound moral values, equipped with competencies, and ready for the challenges in their adult life.</p>

**Policy**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to enable students to have a broad-based, all-round education, CCA participation is compulsory and all pupils must take part in at least one CCA throughout their education in Swiss Cottage.</p>

**Participation in National Sports Associations’ Youth Training Programmes**

National Sports Associations (NSA) may seek the principal’s permission for their pupils to undergo training with the nation youth squads. This includes sports that are not in the school’s CCA programmes. Participation endorsed by the principal and monitored by the NSAs (through progress reports) may be awarded CCA points.

**Choice of CCA**

Students are advised to exercise prudence in selecting their CCAs, and he / she should only choose to do more than 1 CCA if it does not affect his / her commitment to their main CCA.  CCAs should be chosen based on interest / ability and not on the points awarded.
