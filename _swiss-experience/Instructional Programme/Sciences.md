# Sciences

**Rationale**

<p style="text-align: justify;">         

The Swiss Science curriculum is designed to develop Swiss students to be Thoughtful Leaders who can apply critical and inventive thinking to solving real world issues. Students are provided opportunities to explore deeper into the subject matter both within as well as outside of the classroom. All our students will acquire the necessary skills and attitudes to be an independent and self-directed Science learner who enjoys Science and values Science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

**Lower Secondary**

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Students experience learning of science in thematic manner through hands-on activities such as projects, presentation, experiments, field work so they can better appreciate the interconnectedness across the different sub-disciplines of science (i.e., Biology, Chemistry and Physics). &nbsp;They will build a strong foundation to prepare them for learning of science at the Upper Secondary level.</p>

**Upper Secondary**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students who are taking subjects at the G3 level can choose to study two or three science subjects i.e./ 6091 Physics, 6092 Chemistry, 6093 Biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students who  are taking most subjects at the G2 level will learn science at the G2 level, and they can choose to study one of the two combined science subjects i.e., 5105 Science (Physics/Chemistry) or 5107 Science (Chemistry/Biology).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students who are taking most subjects at the G1 level will learn science at the G1 level.</p>

**Key Programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are committed to provide every Swiss student with opportunities to explore and engage in the realm of science. Various programmes and competitions are available to cater to students of different abilities and interest level in science.</p>
