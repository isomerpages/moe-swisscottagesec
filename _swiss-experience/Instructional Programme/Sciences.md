# Sciences

**Rationale**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Swiss Science curriculum is designed to develop Swiss students to be Thoughtful Leaders who can apply critical and inventive thinking to solving real world issues. Students are provided opportunities to explore deeper into the subject matter both within as well as outside of the classroom. All our students will acquire the necessary skills and attitudes to be an independent and self- directed Science learner who enjoys Science and values Science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>

**Lower Secondary**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students experience learning of science in thematic manner through hands-on activities such as projects, presentation, experiments, field work so they can better appreciate the interconnectedness across the different sub-disciplines of science (i.e., Biology, Chemistry and Physics). Â They will build a strong foundation to prepare them for learning of science at the Upper Secondary level.</p>

**Upper Secondary**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students in the Express course can choose to study two or three science subjects e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Biology at the Ordinary level</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students in the Normal (Academic) course will learn science at the Normal (Academic) level, and they can choose to study one of the two combined science subjects i.e., Science (Physics/Chemistry) and Science (Chemistry/Biology).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students in the Normal (Technical) course will learn science at the Normal (Technical) level.</p>

**Key Programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are committed to provide every Swiss student with opportunities to excite, explore and engage in the realm of science. Various programmes and competitions are available to cater to students of different abilities and interest level in science.</p>
