<h1>English Literature</h1>
<p><strong>English Literature</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Why Literature Matters</strong>
</p>
<p>At its heart, Literature is about stories—those that capture the human
experience, spark imagination, and connect us to ideas and emotions beyond
our own. At Swiss, we believe in the transformative power of Literature
to help students see the world through fresh eyes and develop a deeper
understanding of themselves and others. By engaging with diverse literary
texts, students learn to navigate life’s big questions, express their thoughts
with confidence, and appreciate the beauty and power of words.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes the Swiss Literature Programme Unique?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our English Literature programme offers students in the Express and Normal
Academic courses a rich and dynamic experience. From Lower to Upper Secondary,
we nurture students’ critical thinking, creativity, and appreciation for
the written word. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Gateway to the World of Stories:</strong> Students explore poetry,
prose, and drama, encountering texts from around the globe, including works
rooted in Singapore’s culture and heritage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills for Life:</strong> Beyond academics, students learn to read
independently, analyze critically, and express personal responses to the
themes and ideas in texts. These skills are invaluable in helping them
navigate life’s complexities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connections to Real Life:</strong> Through reflection, collaboration,
and discussion, students relate the ideas in texts to their own experiences,
fostering empathy and a richer understanding of the world</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary: A Journey of Discovery</strong>
</p>
<p>In Lower Secondary, students begin their Literature journey by exploring
the three main genres—poetry, prose, and drama. The programme is designed
to spark curiosity and creativity through:</p>

meaningful and fun.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary: Mastering the Art of Interpretation</strong>
</p>
<p>As students progress to Upper Secondary, the focus shifts to deep analysis
and independent thinking. Key features of the programme include:</p>

<p><strong>Critical Engagement: </strong>Thinking routines help students
craft thoughtful, well-supported interpretations of texts.</p>
