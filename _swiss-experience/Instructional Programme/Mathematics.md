<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Mathematics&nbsp;Department aims to develop every student into
a self-directed learner, effective problem solver and strong team player
who is&nbsp;capable of adapting to change and overcoming challenges.&nbsp;Our
key teaching and learning approaches include the use of technology for
learning, thinking routines and varied learning experiences to enrich students’
learning. Using Polya’s Problem Solving Process, we develop students’ problem
solving skills by guiding them to solve problems in an organized and efficient
manner. At lower secondary levels, students are given authentic tasks which
allow them to learn to apply&nbsp;Mathematics&nbsp;in real world situations.&nbsp;Mathematical&nbsp;Modelling
is also used in upper secondary to teach students a systematic approach
to solving problems in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Our Mathematics Talent Programme provides opportunities for Swiss students
with the aptitude in&nbsp;Mathematics&nbsp;to undergo advance&nbsp;mathematical&nbsp;training.
These programmes equip our students with the necessary skills and knowledge
to represent our school at nation-wide competitions such as the Singapore&nbsp;Mathematical&nbsp;Olympiad
and UNSW ICAS. In addition, our students are also given the chance to participate
in many other competitions, such as the ‘All Secondary&nbsp;Mathematics&nbsp;Competition
for Normal Course Students’, ‘NUS Rubik Cube Competition’ and ‘Inter-School
Sudoku Challenge’ to allow them to gain exposure to various&nbsp;Mathematics-related
areas.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Accounts</strong>
</p>
<p>Principles of Accounts is offered to upper secondary students in both
Express and Normal Academic streams. Students learning Principles of Accounts
will develop a keen eye for detail and learn to be organised and structured.
They will learn to use both accounting and non-accounting information to
make decisions, and to become critical thinkers who solve problems and
adapt to the evolving needs of stakeholders.</p>
