# Mother Tongue Languages

**Mother Tongue Languages**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Swiss Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) curriculum, MTL Fortnight event, cultural camp, learning journeys and other enrichment programmes equip students with the linguistic skills to become proficient users of the MTL and be more appreciative of their own culture. This is in alignment to MOE’s policy to make the MTL “living” languages that students will use in everyday situations and develop in students a lifelong interest in their MTL and culture. Swiss MTL department uses everyday situations and contexts, current affairs and contemporary issues as well as authentic materials (e.g. reports, news articles) to provide real-world context for classroom learning. This will allow students to see the relevance of MTL to their daily lives, and enable students to achieve practical language competence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To develop the students’ passion in their MTL language and to develop students’ maturity of thought, critical thinking skills, and their evaluation of arguments and opinions, we have been offering Literature in Malay and Elective Literature in Malay and would be offering Elective Literature in Chinese to the Upper Secondary Students. In so doing, we hope to foster a passion for students to read a wide variety of their MTL literary works, and to deepen the students’ mastery to their MTL language.</p>

<b><u>MTL Fortnight</u></b>

**Chinese Language Experiences**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students were provided with an authentic platform to enhance their language use, and were taught critical thinking and communication skills through the use of learning portal. They learn to craft their views and ideas systematically and further develop the content based on their life experiences and prior knowledge. It was an engaging learning experience for them as they collaborated closely with their peers and also displayed the spirit of self- directed learning in Chinese Language and cultures.</p>

**Malay Language Experiences**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students have better understanding of the different aspects of their language, history and culture through Amazing Race at Fort Canning Park.  They went through hands-on sessions such as playing traditional games, dancing a traditional dance. Indeed the students experience ML as a ‘living language’ in a fun and engaging way.</p>

**Tamil Language Experiences**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students explored the different aspects of the Tamil language, history and culture through an Amazing Race at Sentosa. Thus, they gain a better understanding of the historical significance of Sentosa as a former fishing village and British military base. This cultural camp also provided the platform for students to learn and express historical terms and concepts in Tamil language. These activities successfully kindled students’ interest to use MTL as they were immersed in a fun environment that encourages them to learn and use the language.</p>
