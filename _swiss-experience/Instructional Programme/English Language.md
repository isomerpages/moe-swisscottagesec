**English Language**

*   We recognise and believe that Reading is a vital skill to enhance the EL competency of our learners and thus must be encouraged at all levels as an important input of knowledge, information and exposure to good EL materials.
*   At the Lower Secondary, we focus on building a strong foundation in grammar and vocabulary, as well as developing the confidence in articulating their ideas in the English Language in a variety of contexts.
*   At the Upper Secondary, we focus on applying critical thinking to students’ reading and writing, by deep appreciation of the way texts are constructed for specific purpose, audience, context and culture to achieve the necessary effect.
