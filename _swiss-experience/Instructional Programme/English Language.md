and vocabulary, as well as developing the confidence in articulating their
ideas in the English Language in a variety of contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the Upper Secondary, we focus on applying critical thinking to students’
reading and writing, by deep appreciation of the way texts are constructed
for specific purpose, audience, context and culture to achieve the necessary
effect.</p>
