**Swiss Physical Education Department**

The Vision of Swiss PE Department is to nurture all our students to be ‘Healthy & Fit Thoughtful Leaders of Tomorrow’. Our Mission is to equip each student with the attitudes, skills and knowledge to pursue and advocate a physically active and healthy lifestyle. Our structured PE programme is aligned to the latest MOE PE syllabus and implemented across the levels.

To realise the vision, we focus our efforts to ensure that Swiss students will acquire a range of movement skills. They will learn and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in varied physical activities. In the conduct of our PE lessons, students are taught to demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities; display positive personal and social behavior across different experiences; acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness; as well as enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy lifestyle.

From 2015, in order to further enhance our teaching and learning expertise and to develop more self-directed students, the PE Department embarked on **APEX** (**A**ssessment for **P**hysical **E**ducation e**X**cellence) for all levels. APEX was implemented for Badminton, Basketball, Creative Aerobics Routine and FIT4Life in Secondary 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. For each of the assessed module, a rubric was created to standardise the grading process across the different classes. With the sports skills and knowledge acquired in the PE lessons, students were provided platforms for them to apply what they have learnt in friendly competitions. Special events organized for the students include Swiss Cross-Country, Swiss Olympics, ACES Day workout and Inter-Class Games.

In this era of digital economy and swift technological advances, the Swiss PE Department is constantly on the lookout to explore and innovate to enhance our Teaching and Learning in PE. With this innovative spirit, we embarked on our 6-year journey to develop our Swiss SMARTiFitness system to promote greater ownership and self-directedness leading to lifelong sustained physical health and fitness for our Thoughtful Leaders.

The PE department will continue to innovate and inspire our students to live an active and healthy lifestyle for life.

“Our Health, Our Pride”
