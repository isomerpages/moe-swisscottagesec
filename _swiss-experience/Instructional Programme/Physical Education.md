**Swiss Physical Education Department**

The Vision of Swiss PE Department is to nurture all our students to be ‘Healthy & Fit Thoughtful Leaders of Tomorrow’. Our Mission is to equip each student with the attitudes, skills and knowledge to pursue and advocate a physically active and healthy lifestyle. Our structured PE programme is aligned to the latest MOE PE syllabus and implemented across the levels.

To realise the vision, we focus our efforts to ensure that Swiss students will acquire a range of movement skills. They will learn and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in varied physical activities. In the conduct of our PE lessons, students are taught to demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities; display positive personal and social behavior across different experiences; acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness; as well as enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy lifestyle.

From 2015, in order to further enhance our teaching and learning expertise and to develop more self-directed students, the PE Department embarked on <b>APEX</b> (<b>A</b>ssessment for <b>P</b>hysical <b>E</b>ducation e<b>X</b>cellence) for all levels. APEX was implemented for Badminton, Basketball, Creative Aerobics Routine and FIT4Life in Secondary 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. For each of the assessed module, a rubric was created to standardise the grading process across the different classes. With the sports skills and knowledge acquired in the PE lessons, students were provided platforms for them to apply what they have learnt in friendly competitions. Special events organized for the students include Swiss Cross-Country, Swiss Olympics, ACES Day workout and Inter-Class Games.

In this era of digital economy and swift technological advances, the Swiss PE Department is constantly on the lookout to explore and innovate to enhance our Teaching and Learning in PE. With this innovative spirit, we embarked on our 6-year journey to develop our Swiss SMARTiFitness system to promote greater ownership and self-directedness leading to lifelong sustained physical health and fitness for our Thoughtful Leaders.

The PE department will continue to innovate and inspire our students to live an active and healthy lifestyle for life.

“Our Health, Our Pride”

<b><u>Secondary 1 Modules:</u></b>

Badminton, Outdoor Education, Football, CPR+AED Training

<u>APEX – Badminton</u>

Badminton is a popular game that is ideal for small social groups and is widely played in Singapore. The Badminton module exposes Secondary 1 students to both collaborative and competitive play, hence giving them a head start in movement, gameplay and social skills. At the end of the module, Assessment for PE eXcellence (APEX) is conducted for overhead high clear and singles gameplay, to ensure students have sufficient competency to play and interact with others in Badminton.

<b><u>Secondary 2 Modules:</u></b>

Basketball, Floorball, Handball, PHF/NAPFA

<u>APEX – Basketball</u>

Secondary 2 students will be exposed to a series of invasion games. Basketball is assessed under the Assessment for Physical Education eXcellence (APEX) through self, peer and teacher feedback. This provides the students with an avenue to identify and address learning gaps in specific skills and concepts in invasion games and focuses on developing students’ ability to take intentional steps to improve. Students are taught important skills such as peer observation using personal mobile devices or school devices and use video analysis to critique their own and their peers’ performance. 

<b><u>Secondary 3 Modules:</u></b>

Creative Aerobics Routine (CAR), Softball, Frisbee, Touch Rugby 

<u>APEX – Creative Aerobics Routine</u>

The Secondary 3 PE programme is designed to give Swiss students opportunities to build on their leadership skills and teamwork. The 10-week Creative Aerobic Routine (CAR) Module sees our students work in groups to create a 3-minute aerobic workout from scratch. This platform allows them to nurture their creativity, confidence and leadership. At the end of the 10 weeks, the routines are graded, and the best routine is used as part of the schools ACES Day in Term 3. This student-driven event allows students to take greater ownership and pride in their own creative learning.

<b><u>Secondary 4/5 Modules:</u></b>

FIT4Life, Sport Education Programme, PHF/NAPFA

<u>APEX – FIT4Life</u>

The Secondary 4 PE programme is designed to develop Swiss students into self-directed learners and responsible citizens. The FIT4Life programme is a culmination of their 4 years spent in Swiss Cottage and develops students’ intrinsic motivation to exercise and pursue healthy living beyond their time in school. This module requires students to design and implement a training programme to achieve an optimal level of physical health and performance to enhance their quality of life. At the end of the module, students develop an understanding of how to plan, organise and conduct group workout sessions and experience the benefits of focused and intentional training. 

**Leadership Programme**

<u>Sports Leaders</u>

We develop students into Healthy and Fit Sports Ambassadors through the Sports Leaders Programme.

Students join our programme through the annual Student Leaders Recruitment.  Recruited Sports Leaders consistently develop their confidence and leadership skills through various channels including weekly duties as PE Representatives of their respective classes as well as leading in numerous annual school events such as Swiss Cross-Country, Swiss Olympics, Swiss Past vs Present invitational games, and Swiss ACES Day workout.

Our Sports Leaders are also advocates for Joy of Healthy Living. Every morning, they set up the automated SMARTiFitness stations to facilitate students’ self-directed training and for students in the Fitness Club programme. The Sports leaders are also ambassadors in the Empty Cage Challenge promoting social responsibility among their peers. In this challenge, students inculcate habits of taking care of the environment and taking care of shared equipment. Sports Leaders will continue to be constantly engaged to reassess and redesign programmes for their leadership development, as well as for the benefit of the greater school cohort and community.
