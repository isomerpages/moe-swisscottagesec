# Craft and Technology

The Craft and Technology Department aims to equip Swiss students with creative thinking skills and aesthetic appreciation. Our programme creates opportunities for students to experience authentic learning and seek solutions to real-life problems through collaborative work.

In order to harness the lower secondary students’ inventive and critical thinking skills, and to use technology to create music videos, an integrated project was designed to include these subjects: Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education and Music. The integrated project aims to give an authentic learning experience that allow students to synergise the various disciplines and to show gratitude to their loved ones.

**Art**

SwissART program centers around thinking skills, delighting research, expression and discovery with objectives to nurture artistic talent and developing leaders who draws on creativity to contribute to the society.

**Design & Technology**

Students are engaged in Design-and-make activities and experience the process of design adapted to their abilities, interest and design context. Students will develop important life-skills (time management, problem solving skills, creative thinking skills, etc), design skills (sketching, user-centered research, etc) and learn to manipulate a variety of materials.

**Food & Nutrition**

The Food & Nutrition Unit adopts the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach to engage students to work collaboratively to seek solutions to real-life problems, arouse their curiosity and initiate learning. Students are also given opportunities to familiarise themselves with different process skills (Task Analysis, Research, Decision-making, Evaluation, etc). In the process, students will develop essential life-skills and competencies (self-responsibility, self-assessment and higher-order thinking skills, etc).

**Music**

The 2-year General Music Curriculum includes the learning of Music Elements, Music Appreciation (specifically the Baroque, Classical, Romantic Era), Understanding of roles of music in the Singapore Culture, Creating and Performing Music & Creation of music video through the use of technology.

**Smart Electrical Technology (SET)**

Smart Electrical Technology (SET) is a 2-year course offered to students studying in the Secondary Three Normal (Technical) stream. In the first year, the SET syllabus aims to equip students with the basic knowledge of electrical principles and systems. A combination of theory lessons and hands-on practical training with physical models (the conventional lighting kit and the resistor training kit) helps students visualise abstract concepts through interactions with the models.

In the second year, students will learn the foundational concepts and operations of home automation systems. Through another physical model (the home automation training kit), students learn to analyse and design various control features commonly present in home automation. Students will also learn how smartphones can be used to control lights and other smart devices in the home automation system.

The training in Smart Electrical Technology will prepare and enable students to take up further studies in electrical, control and computer engineering or related fields at post-secondary level.
