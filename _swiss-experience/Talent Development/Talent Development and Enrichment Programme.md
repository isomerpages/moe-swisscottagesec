### <u>Overview</u>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Formed in 2016, the Swiss Talent Development Programme (TDP) is designed to provide an enhanced platform for students to broaden their perspectives on global issues, develop critical and inventive thinking and become confident communicators. Anchored by the Think, Care, Lead framework, students in the TDP take part in various activities, competitions and programmes that challenge them to step out of their comfort zone and grow as Thoughtful Leaders.</p>
