<h1>Care</h1>
<p>In alignment with the school’s aim to nurture Thoughtful Leaders who act with an awareness of local and global contexts, TDP provides students the opportunity to advocate for positive change in society through service learning.</p>
<p>For the past two years, we have partnered Hong Kah North SMC for students to volunteer at the Meet the People Sessions. The attachment allowed students to acquire both macro and grassroots perspectives that kindle a life-long passion to serve.</p>

<h1>Lead</h1>
<p>TDP works closely with the Student Leadership Committee to give students leadership experiences through the participation in leadership conferences and Model United Nations. These experiences develop students into responsible global citizens who are cognizant of pressing world issues and empower them to develop solutions to tackle world problems. In the process, the students develop their oratorical skills and confidence in their personal voice.</p>
