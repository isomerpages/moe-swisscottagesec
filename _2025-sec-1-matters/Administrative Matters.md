<p>2025 Sec 1 students are to purchase their uniform and books based on their
allocated timings and their Orientation Group (OG). They will be informed
of these through PG during the Sec 1 registration.</p>
<p>There will be no uniform trying. All uniform purchase will be done through
measurements. There should be no modifications to the uniform (e.g. tapering
of the pants).</p>
<p>Textbook and uniform buying <u>will start one business day</u> after posting
results release day.</p>
<p>The tentative dates for the sales of textbooks and uniforms for all Sec
1 students would be on 19, 20, 23, 26 and 27 of December. The bookshop
will be open from 0900 - 1500 hrs. To ensure that they have sufficient
time to properly serve the students and parents purchasing, they will accept
their last customer at 1430 hrs. We seek your understanding towards this
matter.</p>
