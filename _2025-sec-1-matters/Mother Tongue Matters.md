<p><strong><u>What is the appeal process for Higher Mother Tongue Languages?</u></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There will not be any appeal for HMTL in secondary 1, instead we will
look at the MTL overall results of&nbsp; the students at the end of secondary
1, if students have obtained an overall result of 75% and above and have
a good learning attitude in class, we would offer HMTL to the students
from secondary 2 onwards.&nbsp;</p>

offer MTL at a less demanding level based on their performance at the PSLE.</p>
