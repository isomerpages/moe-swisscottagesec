**INTRODUCTION**

<p style="text-align: justify;">As parents, we are our children’s first teachers. We play an important role in nurturing our children’s core values. We lay the foundation for learning and prepare them for the different stages of their learning journey. We continue as the key contributors who help to reinforce what is taught in school, be it basic life skills, academic related knowledge, or core values.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of the Parent Support Group (PSG) is to engage and involve the parents of Swiss students in their school life. The Swiss PSG provides avenues for Swiss parents to receive assistance, contribute and/or have a voice in the school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Such collaboration is necessary, as both the school and the Swiss parents have shared interests and responsibilities. We both seek to develop the Swiss students and prepare them in the best way possible for the future. </p>
