<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p>As parents, we are our children’s first teachers. We play an important
role in nurturing our children’s core values. We lay the foundation for
learning and prepare them for the different stages of their learning journey.
We continue as the key contributors who help to reinforce what is taught
in school, be it basic life skills, academic related knowledge, or core
values.</p>
<p>YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE! BE A PART OF YOUR CHILD'S JOURNEY... join the
Swiss PSG by submitting the form via the link (Swiss Parent Connect) below.
Swiss Parents Connect is a platform for Swiss Parents to receive and share
school related information. It also serves as a platform for parents to
ask questions related to school operations and share their experiences.</p>
