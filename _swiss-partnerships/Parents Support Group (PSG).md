**INTRODUCTION**

<p style="text-align: justify;">As parents, we are our children’s first teachers. We play an important role in nurturing our children’s core values. We lay the foundation for learning and prepare them for the different stages of their learning journey. We continue as the key contributors who help to reinforce what is taught in school, be it basic life skills, academic related knowledge, or core values.</p>
