## CONTRIBUTIONS

### Financial Assistance

While our society progresses quickly, there are still some who may need help. To ensure that these students can carry on their studies without any worries, alumni members can make donations. Money collected will be used to sponsor students from families who need financial assistance.

Those who are interested to make a donation can contact the school at 6563 7173. Alternatively, you could drop by the school and pass the donation cheque to our Administration Manager.
