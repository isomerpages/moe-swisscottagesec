<p>Primary 6 students will be considered for DSA into Swiss Cottage Secondary
School based on leadership qualities as well as strong interest and aptitude
in the specific talent area. &nbsp;All applicants must demonstrate very
good conduct and consistently good academic performance.</p>
<p>We consider the merits of all applicants based on a set of holistic criteria.
&nbsp;Meeting all the criteria does not guarantee that the student is shortlisted/given
an offer.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely by prioritising
the student’s interest, aptitude and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’
academic and non-academic requirements/standards, and the programmes available
to develop the child holistically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
