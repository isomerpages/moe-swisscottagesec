_Thank you__, for working tirelessly on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19._<br>_Thank you, for starting work earlier than usual, with a thermometer in hand and a smile on your face, constantly monitoring everyone’s health._<br>_Thank you__, for doing so much more around the school to ensure that our environment is always clean and safe. Your selflessness is deeply appreciated by all teachers and students!_<br>_The idea of making hand sanitiser stemmed from the gratitude that we have for all of you. Some students initiated this project and rallied their peers to be part of it when they thought of how as frontline staff during this busy period of virus-fighting, you may not have access to soap and clean water conveniently. We hope that the bottles of hand sanitiser made with you in mind will come in handy during your busy schedule, as you go about keeping the Swiss family safe. We would like to keep you safe and healthy, just like what you are doing for us._<br>_Thank you for all your hard work!_ <br>_With warmest regards,_<br>_Swiss Cottage Secondary School Staff and Students_ |
