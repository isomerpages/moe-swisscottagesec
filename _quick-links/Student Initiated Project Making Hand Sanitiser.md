|![](/images/Student%20Initiated%20Project/Gratitude-whiteboard_V2.jpeg)  <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><i>To our Frontline Heroes,<br><br>Thank you, for working tirelessly on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19.<br><br>Thank you, for starting work earlier than usual, with a thermometer in hand and a smile on your face, constantly monitoring everyone’s health.<br><br>Thank you, for doing so much more around the school to ensure that our environment is always clean and safe. Your selflessness is deeply appreciated by all teachers and students!<br><br>The idea of making hand sanitiser stemmed from the gratitude that we have for all of you. Some students initiated this project and rallied their peers to be part of it when they thought of how as frontline staff during this busy period of virus-fighting, you may not have access to soap and clean water conveniently. We hope that the bottles of hand sanitiser made with you in mind will come in handy during your busy schedule, as you go about keeping the Swiss family safe. We would like to keep you safe and healthy, just like what you are doing for us.<br><br>Thank you for all your hard work! <br><br>With warmest regards,<br><br>Swiss Cottage Secondary School Staff and Students</i></p> |

<span style = "color: #e31414"> <b><u>Allergy Patch Test</u></b> </span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the ingredients for the alcohol-based hand sanitiser is 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Isopropyl alcohol is also known as isopropanol (or 2-propanol).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), IPA is classified as a highly flammable volatile liquid which can cause eye and skin irritation. It also causes drowsiness or dizziness when inhaled.  It is harmful when ingested.</p>

**It is highly recommended that patch testing is carried out for first-time users of IPA hand sanitiser.** 

Allergy patch test procedure:

*   Be sure the area of skin on which you will be performing the test is washed, dry and clean.
*   Apply a small amount of the hand sanitiser on the upper part of your inner arm (at the crook of the elbow).
*   Cover this area with a waterproof plaster.
*   Leave the patch test in place for least 24 hours without getting it wet.
*   If you are sensitive to any of the ingredients, a reaction such as reddening, burning, itching, or other irritation should occur within twenty-four hours of application.
*   If you see or feel any irritation or reaction, remove the waterproof plaster immediately and wash the area with soap and water.
*   If you don’t see or feel any reaction, the hand sanitiser is suitable for you to use.

**Caution: Do not continue usage if you observe that you are allergic to IPA**.

Hand sanitiser should only be used when you do not have access to soap and clean water. <br><br>Tips on hand washing:<br><br> • Wet hands first with clean water, then apply a sufficient amount of soap and lather well. <br><br>• Scrub hands for at least 20 seconds. Remember to scrub all surfaces. |
