Dear Parents of the 2023 Secondary 2 cohort,

The subject combination exercise done at the end of Secondary 2 is an important exercise that aims to provide our students with interesting and relevant subject options of study at the upper secondary level for future academic progression and careers.

As such, we have prepared a series of videos and slides to help you and your child make an informed decision. These videos will serve as a guide for the considerations and processes of this exercise. The videos will also explain the combination of subjects that will be offered.

Please view the Introductory video before proceeding to the respective videos, depending on which level of subjects (G1, G2 or G3) the student predominantly takes.
